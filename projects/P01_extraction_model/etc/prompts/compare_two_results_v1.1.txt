You are provided with two JSON objects labeled Content A and Content B. Each JSON object contains the following keys:

Registry related
Registry name
Population description
Intervention
Comparator
Outcome measure
Medical condition
Population sex
Population age group
Design model
Population size
Geographical area
Population follow-up

Task: Compare the meaning of each corresponding field in Content A and Content B.

For each key, determine whether the meanings are:

"same meaning" – if the meanings are equivalent.
"minor difference" – if the meanings are nearly equivalent but have slight variations.
"different meaning" – if the meanings are not equivalent.

Output: Return your answer strictly in JSON format following this structure:
{
  "Registry related": VALUE,
  "Registry name": VALUE,
  "Population description": VALUE,
  "Intervention": VALUE,
  "Comparator": VALUE,
  "Outcome measure": VALUE,
  "Medical condition": VALUE,
  "Population sex": VALUE,
  "Population age group": VALUE,
  "Design model": VALUE,
  "Population size": VALUE,
  "Geographical area": VALUE,
  "Population follow-up": VALUE
}

Here, each VALUE should be one of:
"same meaning"
"minor difference"
"different meaning"

Please provide only the JSON output comparing the two contents.

Data:

Content A:
{{content_a}}

Content B:
{{content_b}}
