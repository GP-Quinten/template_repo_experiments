Instruction:
You are an information extraction assistant. You will receive as input the title and abstract of a scientific article. Your task is to extract the following pieces of information (if available) and return them in a valid JSON object with no additional commentary or text outside the JSON. If a piece of information cannot be identified, return "Not specified" as its value.

Here are the fields to extract, along with guidelines for each:
- Is registry: Indicate "yes" if the study is based on registry data, "no" otherwise. If unsure, return "no".
- Registry name: The name of the registry or database from which data were collected. If no registry is named, return "Not specified".
- Population: Description of the population studied, including any relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria or special characteristics.
- Outcome: The main outcome(s), endpoint(s), or measurement(s) evaluated by the study (e.g., survival, incidence of cancer, radiographic progression).
- Study type justification: A brief statement indicating the study design (e.g., “Retrospective cohort study,” “Case-control,” “Cross-sectional,” or a sentence justifying why this design was used). If not explicitly stated, return "Not specified".
- Study type: The categorical study design (e.g., “Cohort,” “Case-Control,” “Randomized Controlled Trial,” “Cross-sectional,” or “Genetic analysis,” etc.). If not specified, return "Not specified".
- Follow-up: The duration of follow-up (e.g., “2 years,” “12 months,” “Median 5 years”). If not stated, return "Not specified".
- Size: The sample size or number of participants/subjects (e.g., “n=500,” “1,000 patients”). If not stated, return "Not specified".
- Age group: The age group(s) of the participants (e.g., “Adults,” “Children,” “18–65 years”). If not stated, return "Not specified".
- Condition: The disease or condition of interest (e.g., “Rheumatoid arthritis,” “HIV,” “Cancer”). If not stated, return "Not specified".
- Intervention: The treatment, exposure, or intervention studied (e.g., “Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors”). If not applicable or not mentioned, return "Not specified".
- Sex: Indicate the sex or gender of participants if specified (e.g., “Male,” “Female,” “Both”). If not specified, return "Not specified".
- Country: The country or countries in which the study was conducted. If not specified, return "Not specified".
- Comparator: If there is a comparison or control group, specify how it is described. If not specified, return "Not specified".

Your output must be a single JSON object with the exact keys shown below:
