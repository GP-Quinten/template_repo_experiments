This was a cross-sectional study of adult patients with at least one brainstem CM identified by advertising on the Angioma Alliance website and from our institutional CM registry. A web-based questionnaire was administered and included self-reported information about the patient, cavernous malformation, residual clinical symptoms, and treatment.

Especially in cases of destination therapy, instead of bridges to transplantation, LVADs require a lifelong commitment. With the increase in follow-up periods after implantation and given the lack of donor hearts, the need for managing concomitant tachyarrhythmias has arisen. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are documented in approximately 20% to 50% of LVAD recipients during long-term device support, according to previous registries. Atrial arrhythmias, primarily atrial fibrillation, generally exhibit good hemodynamic tolerance; therefore, catheter ablation cannot be easily recommended due to the risk of a residual iatrogenic atrial septal defect that may lead to a right-to-left shunt under durable LVAD supports. The clinical impacts of ventricular arrhythmias, mainly ventricular tachycardia, may vary depending on the time periods following the index implantation. Early occurrence after the operation affects the hospitalization period and mortality; however, the late onset of ventricular tachycardia causes varying prognostic impacts on a case-by-case basis. In cases of hemodynamic instability, catheter ablation utilizing a trans-septal approach is necessary to stabilize hemodynamics. Nonetheless, in some cases originating from the intramural region or the epicardium, procedural failure may occur with the endocardial ablation.

A key message from this congress was thatmorequality studies are required todirect thromboembolism (TE) preventive strategies in the ambulatory care (AC) setting. Some of the many high-quality scientific and clinical papers presented (conference proceedings available in Thrombosis Research 2014: 133, Suppl. 2) are summarised below to highlight this key issue. Anticancer care and therapy is increasingly being delivered in the AC setting, with a substantial burden of TEwell demonstrated in this forum, perhaps as high as the inpatient setting. 2 However, there is a lack of consensus in terms of expert guidance for TE prevention. Dr Garry Lyman presented the 2013 updated thromboprophylaxis guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommending against routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for AC patients. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for AC patients with TE risk factors who are at low risk of bleeding, and Italian guidelines specifically recommend pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for lung and gastrointestinal cancer patients. 5 Wepresented our local research, surveyingAustralian clinicians involved in the delivery of care to lung cancer patients, and demonstrated the difficulty and uncertainty experienced by clinicians when considering thromboprophylaxis in the AC setting. Clinicians consistently identified patients with lung cancer receiving anticancer therapies as having a high thrombotic risk in both ambulatory and surgical settings, but with differences in recommendations and variation in practice. The concept of immobility and cancer-associatedTEwas also revisited in viewof the data from theRegistro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboemb\u00f3lica (RIETE) Registry. Among more than 6000 patients with acute TE, 40% of those who suffered fatal pulmonary embolism had recent immobilisation (37%) or surgery (5.4%). Fatal pulmonary embolism was more commonly associated with immobilisation (5%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9\u20133.6) than surgery (0.8%, 95% confidence interval: 0.4\u20131.6). One in three patients dying of pulmonary embolism had recent immobilisation of \u22654 days; yet few immobilised patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (28%) compared to surgical patients (67%). In all, 58%of patientswere immobilised in the home, reinforcing the need for further studies in \u2018ambulatory care\u2019 settings. Whatdoesyourhospital guideline recommend?Popular opinion from the ICTHIC audience was that prioritisation of clinical data acquisition must supersede consensus guideline updates in order to improve patient care in this setting. The outpatient setting is increasingly the preferred treatment paradigm for anticancer care, reducing costs associated with hospitalisation and allowing patients to remain at home. TE is highly preventable yet remains the greatest cause of death in cancer patients aside from cancer itself; evidence-based models for TE prevention applicable to the AC setting are immediately required.", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "design_model_description": "Observational studies", "data_source_name": "Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboemb\u00f3lica (RIETE) Registry", "redirection_link": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a1fd9fed4dfc6ddd0561f71f211b0fa77d36e6c5", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "journal": "Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research", "design_model": "Cohort studies", "summary": "One in three patients dying of pulmonary embolism had recent immobilisation of \u22654 days; yet few immobilised patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis compared to surgical patients, reinforcing the need for further studies in \u2018ambulatory care\u2019 settings.", "keywords": null, "chemicals": null, "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": null, "authors": ["M.

Outcomes were defined at mortality in hospital, pulmonary complications, and ARDS in hospital. Regression analysis was used to determine the effect of femur fractures, while controlling for age, Abbreviated Injury Scales, Glasgow Coma Scale, and systolic blood pressure at presentation. We compared femur fractures with other major musculoskeletal injuries in similar models.

Treatment of orofacial clefts is prolonged; it typically commences after birth and lasts until the child reaches adulthood or even into adulthood. Residual deformities, functional disturbances, or both, are frequently seen in adults with a repaired cleft. Conventional orthognathic surgery, such as Le Fort I osteotomy, is often performed for the correction of maxillary hypoplasia. An alternative intervention is distraction osteogenesis, which achieves bone lengthening by gradual mechanical distraction. To provide evidence regarding the effects and long-term results of maxillary distraction osteogenesis compared to orthognathic surgery for the treatment of hypoplastic maxilla in people with cleft lip and palate. We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 16 February 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 February 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 February 2016), LILACS BIREME (1982 to 16 February 2016), the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) (to 16 February 2016), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 16 February 2016). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the electronic searches. We performed handsearching of six speciality journals and we checked the reference lists of all trials identified for further studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maxillary distraction osteogenesis to conventional Le Fort I osteotomy for the correction of cleft lip and palate maxillary hypoplasia in non-syndromic cleft patients aged 15 years or older. Two review authors assessed studies for eligibility. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We contacted trial authors for clarification or missing information whenever possible. All standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane were used. We found six publications involving a total of 47 participants requiring maxillary advancement of 4 mm to 10 mm. All of them related to a single trial performed between 2002 and 2008 at the University of Hong Kong, but not all of the publications reported outcomes from all 47 participants. The study compared maxillary distraction osteogenesis with orthognathic surgery, and included participants from 13 to 45 years of age.Results and conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the fact that this was a single trial at high risk of bias, with a small sample size.The main outcomes assessed were hard and soft tissue changes, skeletal relapse, effects on speech and velopharyngeal function, psychological status, and clinical morbidities.Both interventions produced notable hard and soft tissue improvements. Nevertheless, the distraction group demonstrated a greater maxillary advancement, evaluated as the advancement of Subspinale A-point: a mean difference of 4.40 mm (95% CI 0.24 to 8.56) was recorded two years postoperatively.Horizontal relapse of the maxilla was significantly less in the distraction osteogenesis group five years after surgery. A total forward movement of A-point of 2.27 mm was noted for the distraction group, whereas a backward movement of 2.53 mm was recorded for the osteotomy group (mean difference 4.8 mm, 95% CI 0.41 to 9.19).No statistically significant differences could be detected between the groups in speech outcomes, when evaluated through resonance (hypernasality) at 17 months postoperatively (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.85) and nasal emissions at 17 months postoperatively (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 66.53), or in velopharyngeal function at the same time point (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.52).Maxillary distraction initially lowered social self-esteem at least until the distractors were removed, at three months postoperatively, compared to the osteotomy group, but this improved over time and the distraction group had higher satisfaction with life in the long term (two years after surgery) (MD 2.95, 95% CI 014 to 5.76).Adverse effects, in terms of clinical morbidities, included mainly occlusal relapse and mucosal infection, with the frequency being similar between groups (3/15 participants in the distraction osteogenesis group and 3/14 participants in the osteotomy group). There was no severe harm to any participant. This review found only one small randomised controlled trial concerning the effectiveness of distraction osteogenesis compared to conventional orthognathic surgery. The available evidence is of very low quality, which indicates that further research is likely to change the estimate of the effect. Based on measured outcomes, distraction osteogenesis may produce more satisfactory results; however, further prospective research comprising assessment of a larger sample size with participants with different facial characteristics is required to confirm possible true differences between interventions.", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "design_model_description": "Randomized Control Trial (RCT)", "data_source_name": "not specified", "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "redirection_link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27689965", "design_model": "Randomized Control Trial (RCT)", "summary": "The study compared maxillary distraction osteogenesis with orthognathic surgery for the treatment of hypoplastic maxilla in people with cleft lip and palate, and included participants from 13 to 45 years of age.", "keywords": [], "chemicals": [], "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": "27689965", "retrieved_from": ["Semantic Scholar", "PubMed"], "authors": ["Dimitrios Kloukos", "Piotr Fudalej", "Patrick Sequeira-Byron", "Christos Katsaros"], "category": "Publication refering to a registry", "pdf_link": "https://boris.unibe.ch/124053/1/Kloukos_et_al-2018-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews.pdf", "population_description": "Patients with cleft lip and palate requiring maxillary advancement of 4 mm to 10 mm", "medical_condition": ["Cleft lip and palate"], "population_size": 47, "mesh_terms": [], "title": "Maxillary distraction osteogenesis versus orthognathic surgery for cleft lip and palate patients."}

Objectives 1-To determine whether patients with SSp and hypocomplementaemia (C3 and/or C4) at diagnosis have an increased frequency of clinical manifestations (at least one of the following: parotid swelling, arthritis, Raynaud, purple, lung parenchymal involvement, renal impairment, neuropathy and lymphoma) compared with patients with normal complement. 2 - Assess differences between groups having each particular clinical manifestations, laboratory abnormalities and treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Methods We evaluated patients diagnosed SSp (all fulfilled the 2002 European American Criteria), using the GESSAR database of those patients with complement determinations at diagnosis. T test or Mann Whitney were used for the analysis of continuous variables and the categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Results 183 patients were taken randomly from 234 patients with complement determinations, 137 with normal complement and 46 with hypocomplementaemia (low C3 and C4 values in 22 patients, low C3 values in 4 and low C4 values in 20). 97.25% were females with a median age of 53.5 (IQR 43-63) and a median follow-up time for 3 years (IQR 1-5). The group with hypocomplementaemia showed a significant higher prevalence of clinical manifestations compared with patients with normal complement (71.74% versus 48.18%, p<0.01). When adjusting for FAN, anti Ro, anti- La and RF this association remained without seeing a confounding effect, or having observed a statistically significant association (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.32-5.63, P<0.01). These manifestations were significantly associated with hypocomplementaemia: arthritis (44.19 vs 20.15%, p<0.01), purple (24.32 vs 5.3%, p<0.01), lung involvement (p<0.01 vs 21.74 6.57), neuropathy (22.22 vs. 9.09%, p: 0.03) and lymphoma (11.76 vs 0%, p=0.02). Conclusions A higher frequency of extraglandular manifestations were found in patients with hypocomplementaemia, with a significant difference between patients with normal complement values. We emphasize that these findings should be considered while revealing the diagnosis of the disease and perform a close clinical follow-up due to the risk of having severe complications. References M.

The traditional risk model provided by the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) is useful for predicting the preprocedural risk of AKI, although the scoring system requires a number of clinical contents. We sought to examine whether machine learning (ML) techniques could predict AKI with fewer NCDR-AKI risk model variables within a comparable PCI database in Japan. We evaluated 19,222 consecutive patients undergoing PCI between 2008 and 2019 in a Japanese multicenter registry.

The incidence of AKI was 9.4% in the cohort. Lasso and SHAP methods demonstrated that seven variables (age, eGFR, preprocedural hemoglobin, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction/unstable angina, heart failure symptoms, and cardiogenic shock) were pertinent.

ICONIC was a placebo-controlled, randomised withdrawal period (RWD), phase 2b study with open-label extension in children (aged 1-18 years) with Alagille syndrome (NCT02160782). Eligible participants had more than three times the normal serum bile acid (sBA) levels and intractable pruritus. After 18 weeks of maralixibat 380 \u03bcg/kg once per day, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue maralixibat or receive placebo for 4 weeks. Subsequently, all participants received open-label maralixibat until week 48. During the long-term extension (204 weeks reported), doses were increased up to 380 \u03bcg/kg twice per day. The primary endpoint was the mean sBA change during the RWD in participants with at least 50% sBA reduction by week 18. Cholestastic pruritus was assessed using observer-rated, patient-rated, and clinician-rated 0-4 scales. The safety population was defined as all participants who had received at least one dose of maralixibat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02160782, and is closed to recruitment.

Of the 29 participants who entered the randomised drug withdrawal period, ten (34%) were female and 19 (66%) were male. In the RWD, participants switched to placebo had significant increases in sBA (94 \u03bcmol/L, 95% CI 23 to 164) and pruritus (1\u00b77 points, 95% CI 1\u00b72 to 2\u00b72), whereas participants who continued maralixibat maintained treatment effect.

In participants who continued to week 204 (n=15) all improvements were maintained. Maralixibat was generally safe and well tolerated throughout. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal related. Most adverse events were self-limiting in nature and mild-to-moderate in severity.

In this study we investigated the incidence of DSWI and effect of re-exploration for bleeding on DSWI mortality. We reviewed 73,700 cases registered in the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database (JACVSD) during the period from 2004 to 2009 and divided them into five groups: 26,597 of isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) cases, 23,136 valvular surgery cases, 17,441 thoracic aortic surgery cases, 4,726 valvular surgery plus CABG cases, and 1,800 thoracic aortic surgery plus CABG cases. We calculated the overall incidence of postoperative DSWI, incidence of postoperative DSWI according to operative procedure, 30-day mortality and operative mortality of postoperative DSWI cases according to operative procedure, 30-day mortality and operative mortality of postoperative DSWI according to whether re-exploration for bleeding, and the intervals between the operation and deaths according to whether re-exploration for bleeding were investigated. Operative mortality is defined as in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Risk factors for DSWI were also examined. The overall incidence of postoperative DSWI was 1.8%. The incidence of postoperative DSWI was 1.8% after isolated CABG, 1.3% after valve surgery, 2.8% after valve surgery plus CABG, 1.9% after thoracic aortic surgery, and 3.4% after thoracic aortic surgery plus CABG. The 30-day and operative mortality in patients with DSWI was higher after more complicated operative procedures. The incidence of re-exploration for bleeding in DSWI cases was 11.1%. The overall 30-day/operative mortality after DSWI with re-exploration for bleeding was 23.0%/48.0%, and it was significantly higher than in the absence of re-exploration for bleeding (8.1%/22.0%). The difference between the intervals between the operation and death according to whether re-exploration for bleeding had been performed was not significant. Age and cardiogenic shock were significant risk factors related to re-exploration for bleeding, and diabetes control was a significant risk factor related to DSWI for all surgical groups. Previous CABG was a significant risk factor related to both re-exploration for bleeding and DSWI for all surgical groups.

Epidemiological data on all reported cases of poliomyelitis were obtained from the Communicable Diseases Division of the Ministry of Health as well as historical records. Coverage of the childhood immunisation programme against poliomyelitis was based on the immunisation data maintained by the National Immunisation Registry, Health Promotion Board. To assess the herd immunity of the population against poliovirus, 6 serological surveys were conducted in 1962, 1978, 1982 to 1984, 1989, 1993 and from 2008 to 2010. Singapore was among the fi rst countries in the world to introduce live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) on a mass scale in 1958. With the comprehensive coverage of the national childhood immunisation programme, the incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis declined from 74 cases in 1963 to 5 cases from 1971 to 1973.

However, in numerous societies most cases go undetected. Primary Health Care (PHC) is an effective place for the management of Suicide Prevention Programs (SPP). In Malekan County, a health community assessment found suicide as the most important health problem. A regional SPP was performed for suicide prevention during 2014-2017. This study was carried out in six steps: (1) Establishing a research team, (2) Improving a registry for suicidal behaviors (SBs), (3) Identifying local determinants of SBs, (4) Training healthcare providers, (5) Follow-up and monitoring of SBs, and (6) Public awareness campaigns. Our ultimate goal was to lower the rates of suicide, and suicide attempt (SA) by 15 and 20\u2009%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals. A total of 821 SAs and 32 suicides were identified. The gender distribution for suicides was 70% males whereas SAs were 64% among females. The majority of suicides occurred in spring 18 (56.25%) while summer was the most common season among SAs 288 (35.8%). Almost 62 and 75% of suicides and SAs have used hanging and poisoning methods, respectively. Hanging increased suicide risk significantly (OR: 8.5, 95% CI 2.9-76.99).

The reason for this increased incidence is the possible inclusion of many neuroblastomas that would have regressed spontaneously and would never have been detected clinically. An extremely rare tumor at the dome of the urinary bladder in a 7-month-old infant was detected by the mass screening. A case of neuroblastoma of the urinary bladder is reported with a review of the literature. The data in the Japan Children's Cancer Registry are also reviewed to analyze the incidence and the site of origin of neuroblastoma for evaluation of mass screening. A 7-month-old female infant was referred because of a positive urine vanillylmandelic acid screening test. Ultrasonography showed a solid mass attached to the urinary bladder. At laparotomy a 35 x 30 x 25-mm egg-shaped tumor was found at the dome of the bladder, and a partial cystectomy was performed. During the operation no changes in blood pressure occurred when the tumor was manipulated. Histologic diagnosis was rosette-fibrillary neuroblastoma originating in the bladder wall, with a favorable Shimada histopathologic classification. N-myc was not amplified, which predicted a favorable prognosis, and no postoperative chemotherapy was given. The patient was free of symptoms and tumor after a follow-up period of 16 months. Literature review revealed that this was the second case of neuroblastoma of the urinary bladder ever reported in the world, although several cases of pheochromocytoma originating in the bladder wall had been reported. Both neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma derive from the neural crest. The sympathogonia from the neural crest, a common stem cell, differentiates into a ganglion cell or into a secretory cell known as a chromaffin cell, able to manufacture catecholamines. The first case in the world that was reported as neuroblastoma of the urinary bladder was in a 4-month-old infant who was noted to have a 4-cm lower abdominal mass on routine physical examination. A ganglioneuroblastoma of the dome of the bladder was excised and the patient was doing well. On reviewing the Japan Children's Cancer Registry, the incidence of neuroblastomas in infants has increased as well as the number of stage 1, 2, and 4s (stage 4 special) neuroblastomas since the introduction of mass screening. However, there has been no significant change in the number of stage 3 or 4 diseases diagnosed in older children. According to the Japan Children's Cancer Registry, pelvic origin neuroblastoma, which has been noted to have spontaneous regression, was more frequent in the primary tumors detected by mass screening when compared with those presenting clinically. During preparation of this manuscript another case of bladder dome neuroblastoma was detected by urinary vanillylmandelic acid screening of 6-month-old infants for neuroblastoma in Japan. These extremely rare cases of neuroblastoma of the urinary bladder involved children younger than 1 year of age and were incidentally detected by routine physical examination or mass screening.

Few data exist on the relative impact of age and inhibitor status on activity levels among patients with severe and moderately severe hemophilia A. The Hemophilia and Thrombosis Research Society launched a registry in 1999 to collect information on subjects diagnosed with bleeding disorders and on their bleeding episodes. As of July 2008, there were 2497 patients registered in the database including 1340 with congenital hemophilia A (333 with inhibitors). Data on activity status was available for 330 subjects with hemophilia A who had ever had an inhibitor (inhibitor group), and 251 subjects with FVIII levels \u2264 2% who had never had an inhibitor (non-inhibitor group). The data was analyzed by age to compare children, adolescents, young adults and older adults. The results show that functional impairment increases with age in both the inhibitor group and non-inhibitor group (chi square, p<0.001 for both groups).

Mean highest inhibitor titers (n=301) was 465 BU (median 50, range 0.6\u201320,000). Current mean inhibitor titer was 26.5 BU (median 0.1, range 0 \u2013 602). Further analysis of the inhibitor group showed that while 67% of the under 13 age group had been exposed to immune tolerance induction (ITI), only 55% of the 13 \u2013 21 age group had been exposed to ITI; the proportion of subjects exposed to ITI falls to 26% in the adults over age 21.\n\nThe HTRS Registry contains one of the largest prospectively accumulated data sets of patients with congenital hemophilia with alloantibody inhibitors. A key advantage of this registry is that it tracks any patient with a history of inhibitors, rather than just current titers, making analysis of demographic data in this group possible. The most striking results from our review of the registry data are the extent to which inhibitor development poses the risk of progressive physical limitations to patients with severe and moderately severe hemophilia over and above effects of age, and confirms that the increased odds of physical impairment becomes apparent early, in the youngest cohort of patients, and continues to widen with advancing age.

One of the least invasive techniques is the ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufficiency method (cure conservatrice et h\u00e9modynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire (CHIVA)), an approach based on venous hemodynamics with deliberate preservation of the superficial venous system. To compare the efficacy and safety of the CHIVA method with alternative therapeutic techniques to treat varicose veins. The Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched the Specialised Register (November 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10) and clinical trials databases. The review authors searched PubMed and EMBASE (December 2012). There was no language restriction. We contacted study authors to obtain more information when necessary. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the CHIVA method versus any other treatments. Two review authors independently selected and evaluated the studies. One review author extracted data and performed the quantitative analysis. Two independent review authors extracted data from the selected papers. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), the number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), and the number of people needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Review Manager 5. We included four RCTs with 796 participants (70.5% women) from the 434 publications identified by the search strategy. Three RCTs compared the CHIVA method with\u00a0vein stripping, and one RCT compared the CHIVA method with compression dressings in people with venous ulcers. We judged the methodological quality of the included studies as low to moderate. The overall risk of bias across studies was high because neither participants nor outcome assessors were blinded to the interventions. The primary endpoint, clinical recurrence, pooled between studies over a follow-up of 3 to 10 years, showed more favorable results for the CHIVA method than for vein stripping (721 people; RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.78; I(2) = 0%, NNTB 6; 95% CI 4 to 10) or compression dressings (47 people; RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.96; NNTB 3; 95% CI 2 to 17). Only one study reported data on quality of life and these results presented graphically significantly favored the CHIVA method.The vein stripping group had a higher risk of side effects than the CHIVA group; specifically, the RR for bruising was 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.76; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 6) and the RR for nerve damage was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.38; I(2) = 0%; NNTH 12; 95% CI 9 to 20). There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding the incidence of limb infection and superficial vein thrombosis. The CHIVA method reduces recurrence of varicose veins and produces fewer side effects than vein stripping. However, we based these conclusions on a small number of trials with a high risk of bias as the effects of surgery could not be concealed.

We aimed to determine whether treatment for breast cancer during pregnancy is safe for both mother and child. We recruited patients from seven European countries with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy; data were collected retrospectively if the patient was diagnosed before April, 2003 (when the registry began), or prospectively thereafter, irrespective of the outcome of pregnancy and the type and timing of treatment. The primary endpoint was fetal health for up to 4 weeks after delivery. The registry is ongoing. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00196833. From April, 2003, to December, 2011, 447 patients were registered, 413 of whom had early breast cancer. Median age was 33 years (range 22-51). At the time of diagnosis, median gestational age was 24 weeks (range 5-40). 197 (48%) of 413 women received chemotherapy during pregnancy with a median of four cycles (range one to eight). 178 received an anthracycline, 15 received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, and 14 received a taxane. Birthweight was affected by chemotherapy exposure after adjustment for gestational age (p=0\u00b7018), but not by number of chemotherapy cycles (p=0\u00b771). No statistical difference between the two groups was observed for premature deliveries before the 37th week of gestation. 40 (10%) of 386 infants had side-effects, malformations, or new-born complications; these events were more common in infants born before the 37th week of gestation than they were in infants born in the 37th week or later (31 [16%] of 191 infants vs nine [5%] of 195 infants; p=0\u00b70002). In infants for whom maternal treatment was known, adverse events were more common in those who received chemotherapy in utero compared with those who were not exposed (31 [15%] of 203 vs seven [4%] of 170 infants; p=0\u00b700045). Two infants died; both were exposed to chemotherapy and delivered prematurely, but both deaths were thought not to be related to treatment. Median disease-free survival for women with early breast cancer was 70\u00b76 months (95% CI 62\u00b71-105\u00b75) in women starting chemotherapy during pregnancy and 94\u00b74 months (lower 95% CI 64\u00b74; upper 95% CI not yet reached) in women starting chemotherapy after delivery (unadjusted hazard ratio 1\u00b713 [95% CI 0\u00b776-1\u00b769]; p=0\u00b7539). Although our data show that infants exposed to chemotherapy in utero had a lower birthweight at gestational age than did those who were unexposed, and had more complications, these differences were not clinically significant and, since none of the infants was exposed to chemotherapy in the first trimester, were most likely related to premature delivery. Delay of cancer treatment did not significantly affect disease-free survival for mothers with early breast cancer. Because preterm birth was strongly associated with adverse events, a full-term delivery seems to be of paramount importance.

Preclinical studies showed that glofitamab leads to T-cell activation, proliferation, and tumor cell killing upon binding to CD20 on malignant cells. Here, we provide evidence of glofitamab's clinical activity, including pharmacodynamic profile, mode of action, and factors associated with clinical response, by evaluating biomarkers in patient samples from the dose-escalation part of this trial. Patients enrolled in Study NP30179 received single-dose obinutuzumab pretreatment (1000 mg) 7\u00a0days before IV glofitamab (5 \u00b5g-25 mg). Glofitamab treatment lasted \u226412 cycles once every 2 or 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected at predefined time points per the clinical protocol; T-cell populations were evaluated centrally by flow cytometry, and cytokine profiles were analyzed.

Pharmacodynamic modulation was observed with glofitamab treatment, including dose-dependent induction of cytokines, and T-cell margination, proliferation, and activation in peripheral blood. Gene expression analysis of pretreatment tumor biopsy samples indicated that tumor cell intrinsic factors such as TP53 signaling are associated with resistance to glofitamab, but they may also be interlinked with a diminished effector T-cell profile in resistant tumors and thus represent a poor prognostic factor per se.

This study aims to identify significant predicting factors of oncological outcomes, including overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and intravesical recurrence-free survival (IVRFS), following RNU for UTUC in Taiwan. A multicenter registry database, Taiwan UTUC Collaboration Group, was utilized to analyze oncological outcomes of 3,333 patients undergoing RNU from 1988 to 2021 among various hospitals in Taiwan. Clinicopathological parameters were recorded according to the principles established by consensus meetings. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was utilized to estimate the survival rates, and the curves were compared using the stratified log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Cox proportional hazard model to explore potential predicting factors.

Although assessment of the draining lymphatics is not a component of standard surgical treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, we hypothesized that the management of breast STS may present a unique situation: given their experience with the more common epithelial lesions of the breast, surgeons may be more prone to sample lymph nodes (LNs) in these patients than would otherwise be indicated based on histologic subtype. We reviewed national surgical patterns of care for regional lymphadenectomy for breast STS using the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) registry. SEER data for LN evaluation are available from 1988. The public-access SEER registry was queried for patients presenting between 1988 and 2002 with breast STS. Data were collated by number of LNs examined and further analyzed by histology, grade, and size of the primary lesion where available. For 5-year relative survival calculations, 210 patients with STS from 1988 to 1998 were analyzed. Relative survival in SEER is defined as the observed survival of a cohort divided by the observed survival of an age-, race-, and gender-matched cohort without disease; it thus serves as a surrogate for disease-free survival. A total of 333 cases of STS were identified for the 15-year period; 39% of patients underwent some degree of regional lymphadenectomy, and the median number of LNs examined in these patients was 10 (range, 1-34). Of all patients, 17.4% underwent lymphadenectomy of 10 LNs or more. More axillary procedures were performed as grade increased (30.8% grade I/II, 53.8% grade III/IV ([chi]2 = 10.8; P < 0.001). The percentage of patients undergoing radical or modified radical mastectomy did not change significantly over the 15-year period (chi2 = 1.25; P < 1.0), although procedures sampling the axilla were significantly more frequent when lesions were larger than 5 cm (chi2 = 4.14; P < 0.05). None of 6 patients with positive LNs survived 5 years.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate a paediatric clinical prediction rule that can be incorporated into an algorithm to guide radiographic screening for cervical spine injury among children in the emergency department. In this prospective observational cohort study, we screened children aged 0-17 years presenting with known or suspected blunt trauma at 18 specialised children's emergency departments in hospitals in the USA affiliated with the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Injured children were eligible for enrolment into derivation or validation cohorts by fulfilling one of the following criteria: transported from the scene of injury to the emergency department by emergency medical services; evaluated by a trauma team; and undergone neck imaging for concern for cervical spine injury either at or before arriving at the PECARN-affiliated emergency department. Children presenting with solely penetrating trauma were excluded. Before viewing an enrolled child's neck imaging results, the attending emergency department clinician completed a clinical examination and prospectively documented cervical spine injury risk factors in an electronic questionnaire. Cervical spine injuries were determined by imaging reports and telephone follow-up with guardians within 21-28 days of the emergency room encounter, and cervical spine injury was confirmed by a paediatric neurosurgeon. Factors associated with a high risk of cervical spine injury (>10%) were identified by bivariable Poisson regression with robust error estimates, and factors associated with non-negligible risk were identified by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Variables were combined in the cervical spine injury prediction rule. The primary outcome of interest was cervical spine injury within 28 days of initial trauma warranting inpatient observation or surgical intervention. Rule performance measures were calculated for both derivation and validation cohorts. A clinical care algorithm for determining which risk factors warrant radiographic screening for cervical spine injury after blunt trauma was applied to the study population to estimate the potential effect on reducing CT and x-ray use in the paediatric emergency department. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05049330. Nine emergency departments participated in the derivation cohort, and nine participated in the validation cohort. In total, 22\u2009430 children presenting with known or suspected blunt trauma were enrolled (11\u2009857 children in the derivation cohort; 10\u2009573 in the validation cohort). 433 (1\u00b79%) of the total population had confirmed cervical spine injuries. The following factors were associated with a high risk of cervical spine injury: altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 3-8 or unresponsive on the Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive scale [AVPU] of consciousness); abnormal airway, breathing, or circulation findings; and focal neurological deficits including paresthesia, numbness, or weakness. Of 928 in the derivation cohort presenting with at least one of these risk factors, 118 (12\u00b77%) had cervical spine injury (risk ratio 8\u00b79 [95% CI 7\u00b71-11\u00b72]). The following factors were associated with non-negligible risk of cervical spine injury by CART analysis: neck pain; altered mental status (GCS score of 9-14; verbal or pain on the AVPU; or other signs of altered mental status); substantial head injury; substantial torso injury; and midline neck tenderness. The high-risk and CART-derived factors combined and applied to the validation cohort performed with 94\u00b73% (95% CI 90\u00b77-97\u00b79) sensitivity, 60\u00b74% (59\u00b74-61\u00b73) specificity, and 99\u00b79% (99\u00b78-100\u00b70) negative predictive value. Had the algorithm been applied to all participants to guide the use of imaging, we estimated the number of children having CT might have decreased from 3856 (17\u00b72%) to 1549 (6\u00b79%) of 22\u2009430 children without increasing the number of children getting plain x-rays. Incorporated into a clinical algorithm, the cervical spine injury prediction rule showed strong potential for aiding clinicians in determining which children arriving in the emergency department after blunt trauma should undergo radiographic neck imaging for potential cervical spine injury. Implementation of the clinical algorithm could decrease use of unnecessary radiographic testing in the emergency department and eliminate high-risk radiation exposure. Future work should validate the prediction rule and care algorithm in more general settings such as community emergency departments.

The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were stomatitis (grade 3, 52 [29%] of 181 patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and 56 [32%] of 174 patients in the best supportive care group; grade 4, two [1%] in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and two [1%] in the best supportive care group) and febrile neutropaenia (grade 3, 51 [28%] in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and 52 [30%] in the best supportive care group; grade 4, no patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and three [2%] in the best supportive care group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 74 (41%) of 181 patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis group and 61 (35%) of 174 patients in the best supportive care group. In the rescue phase, when patients in both treatment groups received defibrotide as rescue treatment, fatal treatment-related adverse events occurred in one (4%) of 25 patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis group (intracranial haemorrhage) and one (3%) of 31 patients in the best supportive care group (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome). Defibrotide did not show a benefit in the prophylaxis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Additional studies of carefully selected patients at high risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after HSCT are warranted.

We examined international and intranational variations in initiating oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy and clinical outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Nordic countries. We also tracked real-world trends in initiating OAC and the clinical outcomes. Methods \u2003We conducted a registry-based multinational cohort study of OAC-naive patients with an incident hospital diagnosis of AF in Denmark ( N \u2009=\u200961,345), Sweden ( N \u2009=\u2009124,120), and Finland ( N \u2009=\u200959,855) and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of \u22651 in men and \u22652 in women between 2012 and 2017. Initiation of OAC therapy was defined as dispensing at least one prescription between 90 days before and 90 days after the AF diagnosis. Clinical outcomes included ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, intracranial bleeding, other major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Results \u2003The proportion of patients initiating OAC therapy ranged from 67.7% (95% CI: 67.5-68.0) in Sweden to 69.6% (95% CI: 69.2-70.0) in Finland, with intranational variation. The 1-year risk of stroke varied from 1.9% (95% CI: 1.8-2.0) in Sweden and Finland to 2.3% (95% CI: 2.2-2.4) in Denmark, with intranational variation. The initiation of OAC therapy increased with a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over warfarin. The risk of ischemic stroke decreased with no increase in intracranial and intracerebral bleeding. Conclusion \u2003We documented inter- and intranational variation in initiating OAC therapy and clinical outcomes across Nordic countries. Adherence to structured care of patients with AF could reduce future variation.The Author(s).

Data on 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality after resection for colorectal cancer were extracted from the digestive cancer registry of Burgundy. Time trends of postoperative mortality between 1989 and 2013 were described for the large population. Case-control studies (death within 30 or 90\u00a0days = cases, alive at 90\u00a0days\u00a0=\u00a0controls) focused on the association between postoperative mortality and surgical approach, obesity and other comorbidities over the last [2010-2013] period, using conditional logistic regressions. Among the 11,448 concerned patients, 30- and 90-day postoperative mortalities were 4.9 and 7.2%. Thirty-day operative mortality decreased from 7.2% (1989-1993) to 4.4% (2010-2013; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for colon cancer and from 4.2 to 3.3% for rectal cancer (NS). Diagnosis before 1997, male gender, advanced age, emergency surgery and palliative resection were associated with a significantly higher 30- and 90-day mortality rate. The univariate risk of mortality was two to three times higher for conventional open laparotomy and conversion than for laparoscopy-assisted surgery. The surgical approach was no longer significant in multivariate analysis. Emergency surgery and comorbidities were associated with higher 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality, whereas obesity was not specific. Postoperative mortality after colorectal resection decreased over time. Surgical approach had no influence on early mortality.

To address this, we investigated the incidence of major fractures before and after dialysis initiation. We performed a retrospective statistical analysis using the Swedish Renal Registry of 9041 incident dialysis patients (median age 67\u2009years, 67% men) starting dialysis 2005 through 2015 to identify major fractures (hip, spine, humerus, and forearm) occurring during the dialysis transition period from 1 year before until 1 year after dialysis initiation. Using flexible parametric hazard models and the Fine-Gray model, we estimated adjusted fracture incidence rates and predictors of major fractures. We identified 361 cases with primary diagnosis of major fracture, of which 196 (54%) were hip fractures. The crude incidence rate of major fractures before dialysis initiation was 17 per 1000 patient-years (n = 157) and after dialysis initiation it was 24 per 1000 patient-years (n = 204). The adjusted incidence rate of major fractures began to increase 6\u2009months before dialysis initiation, and then stabilized at a higher rate after 1\u2009year. The adjusted incidence rate of hip fractures started to increase sharply 3\u2009months before dialysis initiation, peaked at initiation, and declined thereafter. In contrast, the adjusted incidence rate of non-hip fractures was stable during the transition period and gradually increased over time. Higher age, female sex, and history of previous major fractures were associated with increased fracture incidence both before and after dialysis initiation. We conclude that the incidence of major fractures, especially hip fractures, start to rise 6\u2009months before initiation of dialysis therapy, indicating that heightened surveillance with implementation of preventive measures to avoid fractures is warranted during the transition period to dialysis. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

The slope of the reciprocal serum creatinine concentration was similar in both groups before t = 0 (-0.0463 mg/dL/mo in the SG v -0.0438 mg/dL/mo in the CG; P = 0.83), but it became less steep after initiation of steroid therapy (between 0 and 6 months, -0.000742 mg/dL/mo in the SG v -0.0284 mg/dL/mo in the CG; P < 0.001). Finally, only two of the 12 patients in the SG required dialysis at 1 year compared with 16 of the 23 patients in the CG (P = 0.0045).

Ten participants with pre-T2D and ten with T2D underwent three test days with pre-loads consisting of either swallowing water (control), or rinsing with a non-nutritive sweetener solution, or swallowing the sweetener solution before a mixed-meal tolerance test. Blood glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon, glucose, insulin and peptide YY (PYY) were determined at t = -20, 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes. The composition of the oral and gut microbiome at baseline were also determined. The entero-endocrine response differed by pre-loads, e.g. a lower PYY response after swallowing the non-nutritive sweetener (-3585.2pg/mL [95% CI: -6440.6; -729.8]; p = 0.01). But it also differed by T2D status, e.g. a higher glucose, glucagon and PYY response was found in participants with T2D, compared to those with pre-T2D. Evidence for associations between the oral and gut microbiome composition and the entero-endocrine response was limited. Still, the level of entero-endocrine response was associated with several oral microbiome measures. Higher oral anterior \u03b1-diversity was associated with a lower PYY response (e.g. Inverse Simpson index -1357pg/mL [95% CI -2378; -336; 1.24]), and higher oral posterior \u03b1-diversitywith a higher GIP response (e.g. Inverse Simpson index 6773pg/mL [95% CI 132; 13414]) in models adjusted for sex, age and T2D status. Non-nutritive pre-loads influence the entero-endocrine response to a mixed-meal, and this effect varies based on (pre-)T2D status. The entero-endocrine response is likely not associated with the gut microbiome, and there is limited evidence for association with the \u03b1-diversity of the oral microbiome composition.

Although there are various causes of ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF, their medication status at onset has scarcely been studied. This retrospective study aimed to determine the underlying causes of ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF in relation to pre-stroke anticoagulation. Among Japanese patients with acute ischemic stroke enrolled in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry from June 2007 to May 2013, 1,302 patients with NVAF who had been hospitalized within 24 h of onset were included in this study, and their backgrounds, pre-stroke use of OACs and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) on admission were investigated. Strokes were regarded as being non-cardioembolic (CE) type when causes other than NVAF had been identified. The sub-therapeutic range (TR) for warfarin was defined according to Japanese guidelines for pharmacotherapy of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation had been diagnosed prior to onset of stroke in 704 of 1,302 patients (54%). However, it had not been detected before or on admission, but identified later during hospitalization in 270 patients (21%). Of the patients who had atrial fibrillation on admission but had not been diagnosed as having it, 108 (8%) had not received any medication before onset of stroke and 220 (17%) had received medications other than OACs. OACs had been administered to 415 (59%) of the patients with known atrial fibrillation. The proportion of pre-stroke CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores \u22651 ranged from 93 to 99% depending on whether atrial fibrillation had been diagnosed or anticoagulation therapy administered before stroke onset. The PT-INR was in the sub-TR on admission in 283 of 399 patients (71%) receiving warfarin. Male sex, smoking and previous stroke were more prevalent in patients with values within or over the TR of PT-INR than in those in the sub-TR.

Adenosine might identify pulmonary veins at risk of reconnection by unmasking dormant conduction, and thereby guide additional ablation to improve arrhythmia-free survival. We assessed whether adenosine-guided pulmonary vein isolation could prevent arrhythmia recurrence in patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. We did this randomised trial at 18 hospitals in Australia, Europe, and North America. We enrolled patients aged older than 18 years who had had at least three symptomatic atrial fibrillation episodes in the past 6 months, and for whom treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug failed. After pulmonary vein isolation, intravenous adenosine was administered. If dormant conduction was present, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to additional adenosine-guided ablation to abolish dormant conduction or to no further ablation. If no dormant conduction was revealed, randomly selected patients were included in a registry. Patients were masked to treatment allocation and outcomes were assessed by a masked adjudicating committee. Patients were followed up for 1 year. The primary outcome was time to symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia after a single procedure in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01058980. Adenosine unmasked dormant pulmonary vein conduction in 284 (53%) of 534 patients. 102 (69\u00b74%) of 147 patients with additional adenosine-guided ablation were free from symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia compared with 58 (42\u00b73%) of 137 patients with no further ablation, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 27\u00b71% (95% CI 15\u00b79-38\u00b72; p<0\u00b70001) and a hazard ratio of 0\u00b744 (95% CI 0\u00b731-0\u00b764; p<0\u00b70001). Of 115 patients without dormant pulmonary vein conduction, 64 (55\u00b77%) remained free from symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia (p=0\u00b70191 vs dormant conduction with no further ablation). Occurrences of serious adverse events were similar in each group. One death (massive stroke) was deemed probably related to ablation in a patient included in the registry. Adenosine testing to identify and target dormant pulmonary vein conduction during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is a safe and highly effective strategy to improve arrhythmia-free survival in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

This was a prospective cohort study of patients who underwent their first KT between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2014.

The 5-year incidence of post-KT hip, vertebral, and extremity fracture for those aged 65 to 69 years was 2.2%, 1.0%, and 1.7%, respectively.

The total number of person-years at risk for a second primary tumour was 4730. Fifty-four out of 376 (14%) patients had 63 second primary tumours. Forty patients had second primary tumours diagnosed more than 12 months after diagnosis of the pituitary adenoma (expected 42.6, SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67-1.28). A significantly increased incidence of second primary tumours was seen in 42 men with GH-secreting adenomas. Ten second tumours were found (expected 4.55, SIR 2.20, 95% CI 1.05-4.04). A total of 261 patients received radiotherapy and 31 second primary tumours occurred after radiotherapy (expected 32.9, SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64-1.34). Three second primary intracranial tumours appeared within the irradiation volume (expected 0.85, SIR 3.51, 95% CI 0.71-10.36).

Accordingly, a lower CA is expected to be associated with poorer adherence to medication. We investigated the long-term role of CA in adherence to prescribed statins in male patients after a first myocardial infarction (MI). Methods CA was estimated at 18-20 years of age from Military Conscript Register data for first MI male patients (\u226460 years) and was related to the one- and two-year post-MI statin adherence on average 30 years later. Background and clinical data were retrieved through register linkage with the unselected national quality register SWEDEHEART for acute coronary events (Register of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions) and secondary prevention (Secondary Prevention after Heart Intensive Care Admission). Previous and present statin prescription data were obtained from the Prescribed Drug Register and adherence was calculated as \u226580% of prescribed dispensations assuming standard dosage. Logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted associations. The primary analyses used 2613 complete cases and imputing incomplete cases rendered a sample of 4061 cases for use in secondary (replicated) analyses.

It has been suggested that omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are low in SLE patients and that supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs might be beneficial. Omega-3 PUFAs can be metabolized to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) in inflamed tissues. PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), give rise to protectins and E-series and d-series resolvins, respectively. These SPMs help promote tissue repair and healing in addition to reducing neutrophil infiltration. We sought to determine whether EHA and DHA and SPMs were dysregulated in lupus patients compared to controls. Methods Blood samples were collected from 12 patients enrolled in the Autoimmune Disease Registry and Repository, a single center registry (1996-present) of patients meeting ACR SLE classification criteria. Samples were collected from 12 non-SLE-controls who were age (\u00b15 years) and race/ethnicity matched. Metabolomic profiling via tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was performed on serum and plasma to assess the PUFA and SPM levels. Results Levels of EPA and DHA were highly correlated in serum and plasma. Both EPA and DHA were significantly decreased in SLE patients compared to controls (table 1). Neither plasma nor serum DHA or EPA levels was correlated with disease activity assessed by SLEDAI score. SPMs including PD1 and RvE1 as well as their precursors, 17-HDHA and 18-HEPE, were identified in plasma and serum samples from SLE patients. Plasma levels of 17-HDHA, as well as serum levels of PD1, 17-HDHA, and 18-HEPE tended to be reduced in SLE (table 1). The SLE patients with a history of nephritis had significantly lower levels of DHA (p=0.03), EPA (p=0.05), 18-HEPE (p=0.03), and 17-HDHA (p=0.04) than SLE patients without nephritis.Abstract 3 Table 1 Metabolipidomics of SLE and control serum Conclusions SLE patients have lower levels of circulating EPA and DHA, the substrates for SPMs, relative to individuals without SLE. Lower levels of these PUFAs and some SPMs are associated with history of nephritis. Additionally, the levels of PD1, 17-HDHA, and 18-HEPE were measurable in SLE serum and plasma and tended to be reduced, especially in subjects with lupus nephritis. SPMs suppress the production of inflammatory mediators and promote resolution of inflammation. The lower levels of PUFAs and SPMs could contribute to the likelihood of developing lupus nephritis.

We used these VARC-2 standardised endpoint defini- tions to report transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) outcome at our institution. Methods: The study included 350 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at the University Hospital Zurich be- tween May 2008 and November 2012. The Edwards SAPIEN (n = 158; 45%), the Medtronic CoreValve (n = 189, 54%), and the Medtronic Engager (n = 3, 1%) pros- theses were implanted via either the transfemoral (83%) or the transapical (17%) access. Mean follow-up was 389 \u00b1 405 days. Results: Device success within 72 hours was achieved in 88% of patients without significant differences be- tween access sites (p = 0.89) and prosthesis types (p = 0.24). Device failure was due to procedural mortality in 12 (3.4%) patients. In survivors, implantation of more than one prosthesis or malpositioning of the prosthesis was observed in six (1.7%) patients, an increased trans- valvular pressure gradient >20 mm Hg in four (1.1%) patients, and moderate aortic re- gurgitation in 19 (5.4%) patients, respectively. Severe aortic regurgi- tation was observed in one (0.3%) patient. All-cause mortality was 9.1% at 30 days (12.0% in the first half of the patients vs 6.3% in the second half; p = 0.07), and 21.2% at 1 year. The composite endpoint \"early safety\" was met in 67 (19.1%) patients at 30 days (23% in the first half of the patients vs 15% in the second half; p = 0.04). Stroke was o bserved in 2.9%, life-threatening bleeding in 4.6%, vascular compli- cations in 7.4% and acute renal failure in 5.7% of patients. Coro- nary obstruction was rarely observed (0.9%). Valve-re- lated dysfunction requiring repeat procedure occurred in two (0.6%) patients. With multivariate regression analysis, major and life-threatening bleeding within 30 days (hazard ratio (HR) 4.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03-11.07, p <0.001), chronic obstructive pulmo- nary disease (HR 3.41, 95% CI 1.71-6.81, p = 0.001), and baseline New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.18-8.5, p = 0.02) were found to be the strongest independent predictors of all-cause mortality at total follow-up. Conclusion: According to the newly revised VARC-2 standardised endpoint definitions, device success was met in 88% of patients, and the composite endpoint \"early safety\" was reached in 19% of patients.

Additionally, prior efforts to produce an effective S. aureus vaccine have failed, in part due to lack of knowledge of protective immunity. Previously, we demonstrated that anti-glucosaminidase (Gmd) antibodies are protective in animal models but found that only 6.7% of culture-confirmed S. aureus osteomyelitis patients in the AO Clinical Priority Program (AO-CPP) Registry had basal serum levels (>10 ng/ml) of anti-Gmd at the time of surgery (baseline). We identified a small subset of patients with high levels of anti-Gmd antibodies and adverse outcomes following surgery, not explained by Ig class switching to non-functional isotypes. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that clinical cure following surgery is associated with anti-Gmd neutralizing antibodies in serum. Therefore, we first optimized an in vitro assay that quantifies recombinant Gmd lysis of the M. luteus cell wall and used it to demonstrate the 50% neutralizing concentration (NC50) of a humanized anti-Gmd mAb (TPH-101) to be ~15.6 \u03bcg/ml. We also demonstrated that human serum deficient in anti-Gmd antibodies can be complemented by TPH-101 to achieve the same dose-dependent Gmd neutralizing activity as purified TPH-101. Finally, we assessed the anti-Gmd physical titer and neutralizing activity in sera from 11 patients in the AO-CPP Registry, who were characterized into four groups post-hoc. Group 1 patients (n=3) had high anti-Gmd physical and neutralizing titers at baseline that decreased with clinical cure of the infection over time. Group 2 patients (n=3) had undetectable anti-Gmd antibodies throughout the study and adverse outcomes. Group 3 (n=3) had high titers +/- neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with adverse outcomes. Group 4 (n=2) had low titers of non-neutralizing anti-Gmd at baseline with delayed high titers and adverse outcomes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that both neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-Gmd antibodies exist in S. aureus osteomyelitis patients and that screening for these antibodies could have a value for identifying patients in need of passive immunization prior to surgery. Future prospective studies to test the prognostic value of anti-Gmd antibodies to assess the potential of passive immunization with TPH-101 are warranted.Copyright \u00a9 2022 Sherchand, Adhikari, Muthukrishnan, Kanipakala, Owen, Xie, Aman, Proctor, Schwarz and Kates.", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "design_model_description": "This is a retrospective study using data from the AO-CPP registry", "data_source_name": "AO Clinical Priority Program (AO-CPP) Registry", "redirection_link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35923804", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "journal": "Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology", "design_model": "Cohort studies", "summary": "Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-Gmd antibodies exist in S. aureus osteomyelitis patients and that screening for these antibodies could have a value for identifying patients in need of passive immunization prior to surgery, as well as demonstrating the same dose-dependent Gmd neutralizing activity as purified TPH-101.", "keywords": ["Staphylococcus Aureus", "Antibodies", "Glucosaminidase", "Immunoassay", "Osteomyelitis"], "chemicals": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Hexosaminidases"], "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": "35923804", "retrieved_from": ["PubMed", "Semantic Scholar"], "authors": ["Shardulendra Prasad Sherchand", "Rajan P Adhikari", "Gowrishankar Muthukrishnan", "Tulasikumari Kanipakala", "John R Owen", "Chao Xie", "M Javad Aman", "Richard A Proctor", "Edward M Schwarz", "Stephen L Kates"], "category": "Publication refering to a registry", "pdf_link": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.876898/pdf", "title": "Evidence of Neutralizing and Non-Neutralizing Anti-Glucosaminidase Antibodies in Patients With ", "medical_condition": ["Osteomyelitis", "Staphylococcus aureus infection"], "population_size": 11, "mesh_terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Hexosaminidases", "Humans", "Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus", "Osteomyelitis", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Staphylococcus Aureus"], "population_description": "Patients with Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis"}

Disability pension rates were also higher in regions with high involuntary treatment rate. Half of the schizophrenia patients were pensioned off in 5 years.

We aimed to analyse the association between mother's and father's history of homelessness and the offspring's risk of psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorder, during childhood and adolescence. We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of 1\u2008072\u2008882 children and adolescents aged 0-16 years, who were living or born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2015. Parental homelessness was the primary exposure, data on which were obtained from the Danish Homeless Register. The Danish Civil Registration System was used to extract the population and link offspring to parental information, and the outcome, psychiatric disorders in the offspring, was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the Danish National Patient Register. We analysed the association between parental history of homelessness and risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring by survival analysis using Poisson regression and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), adjusted for year and offspring characteristics, and additionally adjusted for parental factors (age at offspring's birth and parental psychiatric disorders). 17\u2008238 (2%) offspring had either one or two parents with a history of homelessness, and 56\u2008330 (5%) children and adolescents were diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder during the study period. The incidence of any psychiatric disorder was 15\u00b71 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 14\u00b74-15\u00b78) in offspring with at least one parent with a history of homelessness, compared with 6\u00b70 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 6\u00b70-6\u00b71) in those whose parents had no such history (IRR 2\u00b75 [95% CI 2\u00b73-2\u00b77] for mother homeless, 2\u00b73 [2\u00b72-2\u00b75] for father homeless, and 2\u00b78 [2\u00b74-3\u00b72] for both parents homeless, after adjustment for year and offspring characteristics). This risk remained elevated after additional adjustment for factors including parental psychiatric disorders. IRRs in offspring were increased for most specific psychiatric disorders, with the highest risk for attachment disorder when both parents had a history of homelessness (IRR 32\u00b75 [95% CI 24\u00b76-42\u00b79]) and substance use disorder when only the mother had a history of homelessness (6\u00b79 [4\u00b79-9\u00b77]). In offspring whose mothers had a history of both homelessness and a psychiatric disorder, 35\u00b79% (95% CI 27\u00b71-44\u00b78) had been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder by the age of 15 years. Parental homelessness was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring during childhood and adolescence. These findings have important implications for public health and policy because they suggest a need for improvement in the support of socially marginalised families to help prevent psychiatric illness in offspring.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been considered to be the main cause of permanent renal parenchymal damage in children with reflux.

However controversy remains as to the optimum strategies for management of children with primary VUR. To evaluate the benefits and harms of the different treatment options for primary VUR. Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings. RCTs were included if they compared any treatments of VUR including surgery (open and closed techniques), antibiotic prophylaxis of any duration, non-invasive techniques such as bladder training and any combination of therapies. Two reviewers independently searched the literature, determined trial eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. For dichotomous outcomes, results were expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using the random effects model. Ten trials involving 964 evaluable children comparing long-term antibiotics and surgical correction of VUR with antibiotics (seven trials), antibiotics with no treatment (one trial) and different materials for endoscopic correction of VUR (two trials) were identified. Risk of UTI by 1-2 and 5 years was not significantly different between surgical and medical groups (by 2 years RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.09; by 5 years RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.26).

In one small study no significant differences in risk for UTI or renal damage were found between antibiotic prophylaxis and no treatment. It is uncertain whether the identification and treatment of children with VUR confers clinically important benefit. The additional benefit of surgery over antibiotics alone is small at best.

ENKTL is invariably associated with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and characteristically involves the nasal cavity, though extra-nasal disease is not uncommon. For a majority of patients, treatment outcomes are unsatisfactory. For localised disease, radiotherapy is effective although up to 50% of patients will relapse, usually within a year of first-line therapy. The outcome of advanced stage and relapsed/refractory disease is extremely poor. The role of high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) in the treatment algorithm of ENKTL remains unclear. Moreover, there is a paucity of data available on patients undergoing HDT-ASCT for ENKTL outside East Asia. The objective of this study was to analyse the outcome of Western patients with W.H.O-classified ENKTL who had undergone HDT-ASCT from 2000\u20132009. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) database identified 102 such patients. Following an invitation to contribute detailed study-specific data, including investigator review of the original histopathology report, a total of 28 patients with full dataset were included for analysis. All patients had a histological diagnosis of ENKTL, with a natural killer (NK) or cytotoxic T cell phenotype in accordance with the W.H.O classification. A majority of biopsies had demonstrable evidence of EBV by EBER or LMP1 staining. For cases where EBV data was not available, cases were only included if a NK or cytotoxic T cell phenotype was demonstrable together with characteristic clinical and radiological features of ENKTL. The median age at ASCT was 47.4 years and the median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 22.4 months. There were no discernible difference in characteristics or outcome between the 28 study patients and the remaining patients recorded on the registry. The median follow-up was 32.8 months post-ASCT. At diagnosis of ENKTL, 57.2% of patients had stage I/II disease. All patients had received at least one line of chemotherapy prior to HDT-ASCT (median 2 lines), whilst only 32.1% had previously received involved-field RT. Remission status at HDT-ASCT was: 43% in first complete remission (CR1); 18% in second or subsequent CR; 21% classified as partial response; and 18% patients with refractory or progressive disease. The 2 year estimates of disease-free survival and overall survival were 40.7% (95%CI: 25.9\u201364.2) and 52.3% (95%CI: 36.4\u201375.1) respectively. Disease relapse beyond 12 months was not seen following HDT-ASCT. The 1-year and 2 year non-relapse mortality (NRM) estimates were 11.1% (95%CI 2.7\u201326.3) and 22.2% (95%CI 8.7 \u2013 39.5) respectively. The 2 year DFS estimate for patients undergoing HDT-ASCT in CR1 was 63.6% (95%CI 40.7\u201399.5) compared with 25% (10.7\u201358.4) for patients not in CR1, although this difference did not reach statistical significance ( p =0.068). There was no apparent impact of age, stage or number of previous lines of therapy on NRM, DFS or OS. Interestingly, the 2 year DFS and OS for those with stage III/IV disease were 33.3% (95%CI 13.2\u201384) and 40% (95%CI 18.7\u201385.5) respectively, with evidence of a survival plateau after 1 year, indicating a proportion of patients with advanced stage ENKTL can be effectively salvaged by HDT-ASCT. This is the largest analysis of HDT-ASCT for patients with WHO-classified ENKTL reported from the Western hemisphere. Survival outcomes are comparable to those reported in East Asian cohorts, although detailed comparison is inherently limited by the nature of the study. Non-relapse mortality is higher than anticipated for a relatively young HDT-ASCT population. Most relapses occurred within 1 year of HDT-ASCT. Outcomes are encouraging for patients with advanced disease.

METHODS We performed an international registry study of patients managed using central molecular, genomic, radiological review and treatment recommendations between 2015-2021. Post-progression treatment included re-irradiation where feasible, and continuation of anti-PD1 with anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab), or a MEK-inhibitor (MEKi). Outcomes included radiological response (iRANO), toxicity, second progression-free (PFS2) and overall survival (OS2). Companion biomarkers were performed centrally. RESULTS Among 75 patients with RRD-HGG receiving PD-1 blockade, 20 are progression-free at a median follow-up of 44.6-months. For 55 patients with relapsed/progressive tumors, continuation of ICI (n=38) resulted in median OS2 of 11.6-months (51% alive) versus 1.2-months when ICI was discontinued (n=17; no survivors, p<0.001). The combination of ipilimumab/nivolumab (n=24) resulted in response/stable disease in 75% with median OS2 of 12.1-months but high autoimmune toxicities (54%). The addition of MEKi led to response in 3/5 patients with prolonged survival. The addition of re-irradiation improved median OS2, especially in tumors with lower mutation burden (p=0.002), and those who received ipilimumab (median OS2=33-months). Several biological insights were gained. Early radiological \u2018flare\u2019 in 33% of RRD-HGG on combined immunotherapy and radiation were associated with immunogenic radiation induced signatures. MEKi responses were associated with reinvigoration of peripheral immune response. Finally, delayed, sustained responses were observed in ultra-hypermutant RRD-HGG exhibiting changes in somatic mutational spectra. CONCLUSION These data suggest that the continuous mutagenesis renders hypermutant RRD-HGG susceptible to checkpoint inhibitors beyond initial progression. The combination with re-irradiation and additional immune/targeted agents can maximize survival in these children and young adults.

For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted (IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to estimate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with non-hematologic cancers. Overall, ALL cases 0-24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count tertiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5-24, ALL cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1 to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035).

Mutations or deletions in eleven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, resulting in protein haplo-insufficiency have been reported in about 54% of the patients. The 5q- syndrome is an acquired myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by a similar erythroid failure. Another RP gene included in the 5q deleted region, RPS14 , has been identified as a causal gene in 5q- MDS but has not been reported in DBA. Purpose: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization has been used to identify large deletions in patients with DBA. This report demonstrates the use of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array hybridization to identify a patient, previously thought to have DBA, as having a 5q- deletion consistent with 5q- syndrome. Method: Seventy-five patient samples from the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry of North America, a patient database of now 608 patients designed to better understand the biology and epidemiology of DBA, underwent resequencing of 80 RP genes. Approximately 40% of the patients had no identifiable mutation. High resolution SNP array genotyping analysis was done on 23 probands from this cohort who did not have a mutation detected in either the resequencing project and/or the targeted sequencing efforts lead by Gazda and colleagues. Result: An acquired internal deletion on chromosome 5q involving RPS14 was identified in one patient with presumed DBA. The patient presented at 5 years 10 months of age with anemia noted on a routine blood count. The hemoglobin was 8.4 grams/dl, MCV 108.2 fL, and reticulocyte count 0.4%. The eADA was normal. The bone marrow showed decreased cellularity and megaloblastic changes in the erythroid series. There were adequate numbers of megakaryocytes with no hypolobulation. The cytogenetics performed at diagnosis in 1991 were reported as normal. The patient had no significant family history of anemia and was found to have no congenital physical anomalies. A diagnosis of non-classical DBA was presumed and the patient failed a trial of corticosteroids. At present the patient has marrow red cell aplasia and is on a chronic transfusion schedule. SNP array genotyping analysis identified mosaicism in two discrete regions covering ~17.7 Mb on 5q-, with an estimated 63.7% monosomy and 36.3% disomy in this region. The major region extends from 141.1M to 157.2M (hg18), including all of the 5q- syndrome commonly deleted region (CDR) at 5q33 though it excludes the 5q31 CDR associated with AML and more aggressive MDS as well as miR146a, a factor recently postulated to play a role in 5q- MDS. SNP array genotyping from purified peripheral blood populations indicated that lymphocytes were greater than 95% normal, while the myeloid cells were greater than 95% 5q-. CD34+ cells obtained from this patient showed a marked decrease in both myeloid and erythroid colony formation when compared with normal cells. Patient fibroblasts were normal and neither of the parents have any 5q anomalies by SNP array genotyping. Although the deletion was not identified in 1991 at the time of the diagnosis, the 46,XX,der(5)del(5)(q15q22)del(5)(q32q33) deletion was able to be detected on high resolution karyotyping in a post-SNP array genotyping marrow sample. Haploinsufficiency of RPS14 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Conclusion: Patients with non-classical DBA may have unique acquired 5q deletions with RPS14 haploinsufficiency. A search for other acquired somatic mutations or deletions in patients with DBA, in particular non-classical cases, is underway. SNP array genotyping is an essential diagnostic tool in this search.

We sought to test the correlation between prescribed minute ventilation and post-resuscitation partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2), and to test the association between early PaCO2 and neurological outcome. We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively compiled single-center cardiac arrest registry. We included adult (age\u2009\u2265\u200918 years) patients who experienced a non-traumatic cardiac arrest and required mechanical ventilation. We analyzed initial post-resuscitation ventilator settings and initial arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) after initiation of post-resuscitation ventilator settings. We calculated prescribed minute ventilation:MVmL/kg/min=tidalvolumeTV/idealbodyweightIBWxrespiratoryrateRRfor each patient. We then used Pearson's correlation to test the correlations between prescribed MV and PaCO2. We also determined whether patients had normocapnia (PaCO2 between 30 and 50 mmHg) on initial ABG and tested the association between normocapnia and good neurological function (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) at hospital discharge using logistic regression analyses. Seventy-five patients were included. The majority of patients were in-hospital arrests (85%). Pulseless electrical activity/asystole was the initial rhythm in 75% of patients.

Microvascular complications are exceedingly rare and treatment is not recommended outside of pregnancy. Diet alteration is not expected to have significant impact on glycemia as glucose homeostasis is preserved. Yet, some subjects with GCK-MODY in the University of Chicago National Monogenic Diabetes Registry report decreased freedom to eat scores on quality of life questionnaires. The purpose of this study was to understand the perceptions of those with GCK-MODY on the impact of diet on glycemia through thematic analysis of Registry discussion groups transcripts. Participants were 56 individuals, ages 23-75 years, and 80% female. Emergent themes revealed division in views commonly held by respondents. One group was characterized as seeing the diagnosis of GCK-MODY liberating their choices and perceptions about food, often accompanied by personal examples of ineffectiveness of diet on changing glycemia. Conversely, a theme of restriction and rigidity was seen in others, with some respondents following strict, regimented diets, and practicing frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose. Fear of complications or health symptoms attributed to GCK-MODY were common motivators for dietary choices. Emotional distress was also frequently encountered. This qualitative study demonstrates dichotomous views held by respondents in regard to the impact of diet on glycemia in GCK-MODY with associated psychological impact. The themes seen in this discussion group are not necessarily generalizable to all individuals with GCK-MODY. Of 388 eligible participants, only 56 people have joined the GCK-MODY discussion group. It may be that those with high convictions in their beliefs about diet are overrepresented in this group. Nevertheless, the significant division in perceptions, focus on diets, and frequency of restrictive diets highlights the need for additional studies into the efficacy of diet on glycemia in this unique subset of hyperglycemia.

Pts with ICD-O-3 code 8520 were categorized as ILC and those with code 8500 as IDC. 9-year BCSM of both cohorts was estimated using actuarial methods. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models characterized association between RS results and BCSM. Results: Of 89818 pts, 9835 (11.0%) had ILC and 64669 (72.0%) had IDC. Among pts with ILC, median age was 60 years; 12.5% were N1 and 28.4%, 63.7% and 7.9% were grade 1, 2 and 3. Median follow-up was 84 months. Chemotherapy (CT) use and BCSM increased with increasing RS result in both cohorts. After adjusting for age, race, tumor grade, tumor size, nodal status, and histologic subtype, the RS result was independently associated with BCSM ( p < .001) in both ILC and IDC. Conclusions: In this linked SEER analysis of pts with ILC or IDC, the RS results were prognostic for 9-year BCSM, regardless of nodal status.

To investigate clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with persistent opioid use in the years following spine surgery among patients with persistent opioid use preceding lumbar spine surgery. It is unknown whether successful spine surgery leads to a cessation of preoperative persistent opioid use. Data from the Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery and the Norwegian Prescription Database were linked for patients operated for degenerative lumbar spine disorders between 2007 and 2017. The primary outcome measure was persistent opioid use in the second year after surgery. Functional disability was measured with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Factors associated with persistent opioid use in the year before, and two years following, surgery were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The variables included in the analysis were selected based on their demonstrated role in prior studies. The prevalence of persistent opioid use was 8.7% in the year before surgery. Approximately two-thirds of patients also met the criteria for persistent opioid use the second year after surgery. Among patients who did not meet the criteria for persistent opioid use the year before surgery, 991 (3.3%) patients developed persistent opioid use in the second year following surgery.

It commonly involves the head and neck (HN) region (41% of diagnosed cases), followed by the upper and lower extremities and trunk in decreasing frequency. We used the Survival, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] November 2021 database to assess the incidence, cause-specific survival, and the association between the primary site of disease and the stage at diagnosis for primary MCC. Methods: Using the SEER-November 2021 (17 registry) database, a retrospective analysis was performed on the 4120 cases of pathologically confirmed MCC (ICD-O-3 code 8247), diagnosed between 2004-2015. Baseline characteristics were assessed using the Chi-squared test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association, with alpha at 0.05. Analysis was performed using SEERStat and SAS 9.4. Results: The overall age-adjusted incidence rate (IR) of MCC was 0.4 cases per 100,000 with an observed 5-year survival [OS] of 47.8% and cause-specific 5-year survival [CSS] of 68.7%. The median age at diagnosis was 79 years (interquartile range - 66,83) with a male preponderance (60.4%). At baseline, males had higher odds of being diagnosed at stages III or IV (p < 0.001). The odds of being diagnosed at stages II, III, or IV were significantly higher in patients with the trunk as the primary site compared to the HN region with an OR 3.8 (p < 0.001), 2.4 (p < 0.001), and 2.2 (p = 0.001), respectively. For patients with the upper limb as the primary site, the odds of being diagnosed at stage II were 1.4 times higher than the HN region (p = 0.0095), and stage IV was 0.4 times (p = 0.03) higher. For the lower limb and hip, the odds of being diagnosed at stages II, III, or IV were significantly higher than the HN region with an OR 2.6 (p < 0.001), 1.6 (p < 0.0005), and 1.5 (p = 0.04), respectively. Conclusions: While less prevalent than the MCC of the HN region, patients with MCC of the trunk, upper or lower extremities had a higher probability of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage malignancy compared to the former.

However, credible estimates of LC-CID rely on accurate cause-of-death coding in death certificates. Results from lung cancer screening trials estimated 15% under-reporting and 1% over-reporting of lung cancer deaths due to misclassification. This study investigated the impact of cause-of-death misclassification on the estimation of LC-CID. Patients with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry were included. LC-CID was estimated using the competing-risk approach in two ways: (1) reporting observed estimates that ignore potential cause-of-death misclassification and (2) correcting for plausible misclassification rates reported in the literature (15% under-reporting and 1% over-reporting). Bias was quantified as the difference between observed and corrected 10-year LC-CIDs: positive values indicated that observed LC-CID overestimated true LC-CID, whereas negative values indicated the opposite. Among 66,179 patients, the impact of over-reporting on 10-year LC-CID was negligible across all age groups. In contrast, under-reporting resulted in substantial underestimation of 10-year LC-CID. The biases increased as age increased due to higher LC-CIDs: 10-year LC-CIDs among stage I patients 18-44, 45-59, 60-74 and \u226575 years were 25%, 32%, 41%, and 50%, respectively, and the corresponding biases given the plausible misclassification rates were -4.4%, -5.6%, -7.1%, and -8.6%.

To determine the effect on vaccination rates of an automated telephonic intervention for adults in need of either pneumococcal vaccination or herpes zoster vaccination, or both. Over a 1-year period, patients with identified vaccine gaps at 246 pharmacies of 3 pharmacy chains were randomly assigned to receive either usual care or an automated telephonic prompt for pneumococcal and/or herpes zoster vaccines based on patient records contained in state immunization registries and pharmacy data.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of specific nutrition adjustment program on specific liver findings in children with chronic liver disease.Methods: In this clinical trial study, 75 children with chronic liver disease were randomly divided into two groups (45 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group). At the beginning of the study, the necessary experiments were taken from two groups. The intervention group received a nutritional adjustment program during 6 sessions of the workshop. After 12 weeks of follow-up, bilirubin level (total, direct), albumin level, PT, INR, transaminases (AST, ALT) were measured in both groups. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 16 and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests.Results: At the beginning of the study, both groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables. In the post-intervention stage compared to the pre-intervention stage in the intervention group, the mean scores of prothrombin time (P = 0/040), albumin (P = 0/007), aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase (p\u02c20/001)were statistically significant:. But the mean score of total bilirubin (P = 0/063) in the post-intervention stage compared to before the intervention in the intervention group was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Nutrition education and encouragement of patients with chronic liver disease to follow a special diet can be an important factor in feeling healthy and preventing the progression of the disease.Trial registration: Name of registry: Zahra NamjouIRCT registration number: IRCT2015091424019N1 Registration date: 2016-01-30 Registration timing: retrospective", "population_follow_up": "12 weeks", "design_model_description": "Clinical trial", "data_source_name": "Zahra Namjou", "journal": null, "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "redirection_link": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b15ce18b87d370367a199b8a52c1662d3d64aa6d", "design_model": "Randomized Control Trial (RCT)", "summary": "Nutrition education and encouragement of patients with chronic liver disease to follow a special diet can be an important factor in feeling healthy and preventing the progression of the disease.", "keywords": null, "chemicals": null, "pmid": null, "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "retrieved_from": ["Semantic Scholar"], "authors": ["S.

The American Cancer Society recommends clinical breast exam about every 3 years and breast self-exam as an option for women starting in their 20s. It is not clear what method is best for women at high risk. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all women presenting with primary breast cancer, aged 21-39, biopsy confirmed Stage 0-IV from 1990-2008 identified and tracked by our registry. Clinical presentation characteristics including age, race, TNM stage converted to AJCC 6, first degree relative, family and pregnancy history, histologic type and method of detection by patient (PtD), physician (PhysD) or mammography (MgD) were chart abstracted at the time of diagnosis. A first degree relative is a mother, father, son, daughter or sibling with a BC diagnosis. Cases with unknown or other method of detection (n=7) were removed (n=602). For analysis purposes patient and physician detected cases were combined into one manually detected category. Forward conditional stepwise regression was used to test association significance with detection method and the Kaplan-Meier method was used for disease free survival (DFS) analysis. Results: Women aged 21-39 represented 7% of the patients in our community based cancer center registry database. We did not observe any change in detection method over time with 12% MgD, 7% PhysD and 81% PtD. The majority of MgD cases were in the 30-34 (26%) and 35-39 (65%) year old age groups (Pearson chi square = 11.11, p=.011). 81% of the PhysD/PtD breast cancers were visible on subsequent mammography. 31% of the 74 MgD cases were stage 0 vs. 2.5% of the 528 PhysD/PtD cases. In a conditional logistic regression model with MgD BC yes/no as the binary outcome, age at diagnosis and having a first degree relative with breast cancer were significantly associated with mammography detection. DFS was significantly better in the MgD group (log rank test = 6.10, p=.014). Conclusions: Mammography detection in 20-39 year old breast cancer patients is associated with age > 30 years and presence of a BC affected first degree relative. Disease specific survival is significantly better in the mammography detected group largely due to lower stage at diagnosis. These results indicate mammography may be a reasonable option for screening high risk women aged 30-39. Figure available in online version.

Methods-Since 1984 patients diagnosed with STD visiting STD clinics and local public health services in the Netherlands are reported by the nursing staffs. In addition to diagnosis and gender of the patient epidemiological background information is registered. The reported annual cases of gonorrhoea, syphilis and Chlamydia trachomatis infections are presented. Further, the epidemiological features of over 25,000 patients with infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis, gonorrhoea or syphilis infections were compared. Results-During the period 1984-1990 an overall decrease in the total number of gonorrhoea infections was reported; among homosexual males; however, an increase in gonorrhoea rates and an increasing number of sexual partners after 1989 was reported. Furthermore, the percentage of gonorrhoea infections caused by penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae was found to be on the increase in various subgroups but not in homosexual males. Syphilis rates among females declined from 1984 to 1987 after which an increase was reported reaching a peak in 1989; syphilis rates among males peaked during 1989. After 1988 Chlamydia trachomatis infections increased which, however, is largely due to the introduction of screening among all visitors of the Amsterdam STD service resulting in improved casedetection. Finally, it appeared that STDs are not randomly distributed over the population but are associated with certain patient characteristics. Conclusion-The data provided by STD services reveal an epidemiological pattern for STDs in the Netherlands. The increase in the reported number of gonorrhoea infections among homosexuals together with the increasing number of sexual partners among homosexual males suggest that p group of highly sexually active individuals switch or return to higher risk behaviours. Further research is needed to determine the causes of the described trends and behavioural changes in order to undertake preventive activities. (Genitourin Med 1993;69:434-438) Introduction For various European countries, among which are the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy and Belgium, trends in STD have been published.l4 In these countries data are usually obtained from laboratory surveillance reports or the notification system, which often do not include epidemiological information. Until 1983 STD trends in the Netherlands were only available from the notification system while epidemiological background information was provided mainly by a large STD clinic in Amsterdam.5 6 Notified cases of gonorrhoea or syphilis are documented anonymously according to date and place of reporting. In order to obtain more epidemiological information about the incidence of STD, the Director of Health established an additional registry of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in 1983; this registry was to be maintained in addition to the system of statutory notification of specific diseases in the Netherlands. Data for this registry are collected by the nursing staffs of STD services all over the country; not only diagnosis and gender of the patient but also epidemiological background information are registered. This is the only longitudinal data collection system which includes epidemiological information relevant to STD in the Netherlands. In this article the data collected between 1984 and 1990 are presented. The purpose of this study was to explore general trends in STD in subgroups characterised by age, gender, sexual preference, number of sexual partners and prostitution; the detailed background information collected by STD service data give an insight into possible factors underlying the general trends. Materials and methods Registration of STD is carried out by the nursing staffs of 44 STD services (including local public health services and STD hospital clinics), located all over the country. The STD services in the major cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Groningen and Utrecht) together account for 69A4% of the data of which the greater part (42.0% of all data) is reported by the municipal STD clinic of Amsterdam. In the STD services cure, treatment, contact tracing and counselling are free of charge. Together with general practitioners and dermatologists (irrespective of whether they have hospital facilities), STD services represent the major portion of the health care network for patients with STD in the Netherlands. It has been estimated that 21 Oo of the STD patients attend the STD services while 77% visit their general practitioner or dermatologist.7 These percentages TNO Institute of Preventive Health Care, Leiden, The Netherlands H F Treurniet W Davidse Address correspondence to: H F Treurniet, TNO Institute of Preventive Health Care, PO Box 124, 2300 AC Leiden, The Netherlands Accepted for publication 29 June 1993 434 Sexually transmitted diseases reported by STD servces in the Netherlands, 1984-1990 Table 1 Number of cases ofgonorrhoea, syphilis and Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the STD registry Year 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 gonorrhoea 9410 7266 5606 3079 1968 1971 1846 syphilis 861 643 504 391 399 512 422 Chlamydia trachomas infections 1169 1812 2082 1917 165", "data_source_name": "Dutch STD Registry", "design_model_description": "Observational studies", "population_follow_up": "1984-1990 (6 years)", "journal": null, "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "redirection_link": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1c87599021f9e22250b6e9e5b2ea6b93e0116b90", "design_model": "Cohort studies", "summary": "The data provided by STD services reveal an epidemiological pattern for STDs in the Netherlands and the increase in the reported number of gonorrhoea infections among homosexuals together with the increasing number of sexual partners among homosexual males suggest that p group of highly sexually active individuals switch or return to higher risk behaviours.", "keywords": null, "chemicals": null, "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": null, "retrieved_from": ["Semantic Scholar"], "authors": ["H.

These registries may not always be managed by the same organization and, furthermore, privacy legislation or practices may restrict any data linkages of records that can actually be done among registries. The objective of this study was to develop a secure protocol for linking data from different registries and to allow on-going monitoring of HPV vaccine effectiveness. Methods A secure linking protocol, using commutative hash functions and secure multi-party computation techniques was developed. This protocol allows for the exact matching of records among registries and the computation of statistics on the linked data while meeting five practical requirements to ensure patient confidentiality and privacy. The statistics considered were: odds ratio and its confidence interval, chi-square test, and relative risk and its confidence interval. Additional statistics on contingency tables, such as other measures of association, can be added using the same principles presented. The computation time performance of this protocol was evaluated. Results The protocol has acceptable computation time and scales linearly with the size of the data set and the size of the contingency table. The worse case computation time for up to 100,000 patients returned by each query and a 16 cell contingency table is less than 4 hours for basic statistics, and the best case is under 3 hours.

If catheter ablation of arrhythmias has been extensively evaluated in the scientific context, much less is known about clinical practice in this field. The previously published studies reflect results obtained in a small number of selected patients treated by well-experienced operators in high-volume single centres, and whether extrapolation of these results can be made in the \u2018real world\u2019 of daily practice remains unknown. The study by Kesek et al. reported in this issue of Europace provides a nation-wide database of RFA procedures in Sweden collecting data from all eight centres serving a country\u2019s population of 9.18 million inhabitants. The authors are to be congratulated on the rigorous and extensive nature of the registry representing the real-life practice evaluating both safety and efficacy of RFA procedures in Sweden in 2007. The Swedish registry gives us detailed information on RFA procedures performed in a whole country. The first relevant information is the total number of RFA interventions performed per year. This latter point is important since the number of procedures per million of inhabitants in individual countries is not well known. It can be expected that several factors other than medical ones like local practice traditions and national health policies may influence the total number of interventions performed in a given country. In the Swedish registry, the data covered 7018 ablations carried out in 5885 patients during 2004\u201307, with 2314 ablations procedures performed in 2007, representing 252 ablations per million of inhabitants. These findings are in agreement with other published European registries. During the last decade, catheter ablation procedures rates continued to grow with both increase in rates of success and decrease in rates of complications. 5 Success rates of catheter ablation vary in the published literature but generally RFA of APs, AVRNT, atrioventricular junction (AVJ), and AFL can be performed with success rates .95%, low recurrence rates ( 5%), and relatively low incidence of complications. It is well admitted that the probability of ablation success is higher among patients with AFL and AVJ, whereas it is lower in patients with AP and intermediate in the AVNRT group. Kesek et al. found that the primary success for AVNRT, AP, AFL, and ectopic atrial tachycardia were 96, 89, 87, and 71%, respectively. These rates of success are similar to those reported in recent published studies or other registries, except for AFL ablation. \u20135,8 Indeed, primary success of AFL is expected to be close to 100%, mainly due to technical progress (8 mm tip and cooled-tip catheters use) and a better evaluation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus bidirectional block. It is therefore quite strange to find an AFL primary success of only 87% in the Sweden registry, but the figure was based on only 50% of procedures analysis, which can be an explanation for such low success rates. Moreover, the proportion of patients treated for AFL appears to be low (18%) in the study by Kesek et al., 6 representing the fourth indication compared with AVNRT (24.6%), atrial fibrillation (AFib) (22.5%), and AP (18.5%) procedures. Was this low proportion of patients treated for AFL due to first intent medical treatment approach in agreement with national policies or was it due to a low prevalence of AFL in Sweden? In a recent prospective study published on the subject, RFA was associated with both fewer secondary effects and higher long-term success rate when compared with the first-line medical treatment supporting RFA even after the first AFL episode.

As potential therapies for PCS emerge, RVA parameters may become relevant as clinical biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy management. This study was previously registered at ClinicalTrials (\"All Eyes on PCS-Analysis of the Retinal Microvasculature in Patients with Post-COVID-19 Syndrome\". NCT05635552. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05635552 ). Persistent endothelial dysfunction in post-COVID-19 syndrome. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection indirectly or directly causes endotheliitis in patients. N\u2009=\u200941 PCS patients were recruited and retinal vessel analysis was performed to assess microvascular endothelial function. Images of SVA and DVA are illustrative for RVA data analysis. For each PCS patient and healthy cohort, venular vessel diameter of the three measurement cycles was calculated and plotted on a diameter-time curve. Patients exhibited reduced flicker-induced dilation in veins (vFID) measured by dynamic vessel analysis (DVA) and lower central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR) and a tendency towards higher central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) when compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection na\u00efve participants.

Background and Purpose \u2014The risk for stroke is higher in low-income groups. It is not clear whether these groups also have a higher risk for death after a stroke. Methods \u2014We studied survival in relation to income and level of education in all patients aged >40 years admitted to hospital for stroke in Denmark in 2003 to 2012. All Danish hospitals report data to the Danish Stroke Register for all patients admitted for acute stroke, including age, sex, stroke severity, subtype, and a cardiovascular risk profile. Information on income and education was obtained from Statistics Denmark; deaths from all causes from the Civil Registration Registry. Results \u2014Information on education and disposable income was available for 56 581 Danes hospitalized for strok e during the 9.5-year study period. Median length of follow-up was 3.1 years. For the entire follow-up period, there was a significant, stepwise, independent relation between income and risk for death after stroke, which was 30% higher for the lowest than for the highest quintile income group (relative risk, 0.70, 95% confidence interval, 0.65\u20130.74).

To assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with the RestoreX device plus collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) compared with CCH alone and CCH with other PTT devices. A prospective registry has been maintained of all men undergoing CCH injections for PD between March 2014 and January 2019. Assessments were performed at baseline, during each series, and after completion of treatment. Those completing therapy (8 injections or sooner if satisfied) were categorized into group 1 (CCH alone), group 2 (CCH plus any PTT device other than RestoreX), or group 3 (CCH plus RestoreX). Changes in penile length, curvature, and subjective perception and the occurrence of adverse events. Of 287 men with data on PTT use, 113 had completed therapy with all objective data available and compose the current cohort. Baseline demographic and pathophysiological variables were similar among the 3 groups except penile length and previous PD medications. Following treatment, group 3 demonstrated significantly greater improvements in curvature (mean, 20.3\u00b0/31% for group 1, 19.2\u00b0/30% for group 2, and 33.8\u00b0/49% for group 3), length (-0.7 cm/-4%, -0.4 cm/-2%, and\u00a0+1.9 cm/+17%, respectively), and subjectively estimated curvature improvement (44%, 32%, and 63% respectively), despite shorter daily PTT use (0.9 vs 1.9 hours/day). Group 3 was more likely than the other groups to experience \u226520\u00b0, \u226520%, and \u226550% curvature improvements, \u22651 cm length gain, and \u226520% length improvement. All results were statistically significant for group 3 versus groups 1 and 2, but not between groups 1 and 2, even after controlling for baseline features and isolating a subset of \u22653 hours/day PTT use (group 2). Group 3 was 6.9 times more likely to achieve \u226520\u00b0 curvature improvement, and 3.5 times more likely to achieve \u226550% curvature improvement, and 10.7 times more likely to experience \u226520% length improvement. Adverse events were similar among the 3 groups. Use of the RestoreX device enhances mean curvature outcomes by 71% and increases penile length in men with PD receiving CCH therapy. Study strengths include a prospective registry, consistent assessments, the largest single-site series with complete posttreatment outcomes reported to date, the largest PTT series reported to date, and a true-to-life clinical design. Limitations include the nonrandomized methodology and single-site setting. The combination of RestoreX and CCH is associated with significantly greater curvature and length improvements compared with CCH alone or CCH with other PTT devices.

The second part includes pharmacoepidemiological studies on birth outcome after anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy, including patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The third part (and the latest publications) includes birth outcome in women with Crohn's disease; and the methods of cohort establishment in these studies are developed and improved due to the knowledge gathered from conducting the earlier studies. The birth outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis are examined in a nationwide, Danish, cohort of women based on data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry and the Danish Medical Birth Registry, and within a Hungarian case-control data set. Our data suggest: 1) Significantly increased risk of preterm birth when women give birth 0-6 months after establishment of the diagnosis. It is considered whether the increased risk may be influenced by disease activity around the time of establishing the diagnosis. 2) No increased risk of giving birth to children with low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities (evaluated overall). 3) Significantly increased risk of some selected congenital abnormalities (limb deficiencies, obstructive urinary and multiple congenital abnormalities). No other studies have examined the risk of selected congenital abnormalities in children born by women with ulcerative colitis. The pharmacoepidemiological studies on birth outcomes after use of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy, including women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are based on data from the Hungarian case-control data set, a countywide Danish prescription Database, the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry, the Danish Medical Birth Registry, and review of selected medical records. After exposure to sulfasalazine during pregnancy our data suggest. No significantly increased overall relative risk of congenital abnormalities and no significantly increased risks of selected congenital abnormalities. After exposure to 5-aminosalicylic acid during pregnancy our data suggest. No significantly increased relative risk of low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities (evaluated overall). A significantly increased relative risk of preterm birth and stillbirth in ulcerative colitis women, compared to women with no prescription of reimbursed medicine in pregnancy - and also after comparing with women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease not taking 5-aminosalicylic acid during pregnancy. It is not clear whether these associations are causal or influenced by confounding by disease activity in particular. After maternal exposure to azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine during pregnancy our data suggest. An increased relative risk of preterm birth, congenital abnormalities, and perinatal mortality - also after using controls with similar underlying diseases. It is difficult to rule out an influence of uncontrolled confounding. These were the first published data from a controlled observational study on exposed women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. After preconceptional paternal use of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine our data suggest An increased risk of congenital abnormalities, although not significantly increased. The birth outcomes in women with Crohn's disease are examined in nationwide sub-cohorts classified according to type of anti-inflammatory drug exposure during pregnancy, and based on data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry, the nationwide Danish Prescription Database and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Furthermore, birth outcomes are examined in Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy, based on data from review of hospital records, the Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry and the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Our data suggest: 1) The risk of adverse birth outcomes in women with Crohn's disease varies according to the type of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in pregnancy. 2) Reassuring results according to low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth and congenital abnormalities after use of sulfasalazine/5-aminosalicylic acid or steroids. 3) Worrisome findings of a significantly increased risk of preterm birth and an increased risk of congenital abnormalities (not significantly increased) after prescription of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Some residual confounding by disease activity may have been left in the analyses of preterm birth. In Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy our data suggest: 1) A significantly increased relative risk of preterm birth in women with the highest degree of disease activity during pregnancy. 2) Disease activity does not seem to increase the risk of low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation or congenital abnormalities. This study is the first epidemiological study of the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Crohn's disease women with disease activity during pregnancy, compared to women with no activity during pregnancy, and in which confounders have been taken into consideration. Exceeding the studies included in my previous PhD thesis, this thesis provides new evidence on the following subjects: i) the risk of selected congenital abnormalities in children of women with ulcerative colitis, ii) pharmacoepidemiological studies on the risk of adverse birth outcome after maternal azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine exposure in pregnancy, and the risk of congenital abnormalities in children fathered by men treated with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine before conception, iii) the risk of adverse birth outcome in women with Crohn's disease according to type of anti-inflammatory drug treatment in pregnancy (sulfasalazine/5-aminosalicylic acid, steroids or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine), and iv) the impact of disease activity in women with Crohn's disease on adverse birth outcome. We learned from the studies in this thesis that the traditional way of reporting birth outcome in women with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, i.e. without having valid information on the type of underlying disease, concurrent therapeutic drug treatment and disease activity, is of limited value. The studies show that the risk of specific adverse birth outcome in women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease depends on several factors including the time of birth in relation the d\u00e9but of disease, the type of underlying disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), the type of anti-inflammatory drug treatment during pregnancy, and the degree of disease activity during pregnancy. At the same time one also has to realize that the existing evidence is still limited, especially in the field of reproductive safety after therapeutic drug treatment during pregnancy and possible effects of preconceptional therapeutic drug exposure.", "data_source_name": "Danish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Danish Medical Birth Registry, Hungarian case-control data set, countywide Danish prescription Database", "design_model_description": "Cohort studies, case-control studies", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "redirection_link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22142578", "population_sex": ["Female"], "journal": "Danish medical bulletin", "design_model": "Not specified", "summary": "The clinical epidemiological studies included in this thesis fall into three parts; the methods of cohort establishment in these studies are developed and improved due to the knowledge gathered from conducting the earlier studies, and it is not clear whether these associations are causal or influenced by confounding by disease activity in particular.", "keywords": [], "chemicals": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Sulfasalazine", "Aminosalicylic Acid", "Mercaptopurine", "Azathioprine"], "pmid": "22142578", "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "authors": ["Bente Mertz N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd"], "retrieved_from": ["PubMed", "Semantic Scholar"], "category": "Publication refering to a registry", "pdf_link": null, "title": "Birth outcome in women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and pharmacoepidemiological aspects of anti-inflammatory drug therapy.", "population_description": "Pregnant women with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease", "population_size": null, "mesh_terms": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Aminosalicylic Acid", "Anti Inflammatory Agents", "Anti Inflammatory Agents, Non Steroidal", "Azathioprine", "Colitis, Ulcerative", "Confidence Intervals", "Crohn Disease", "Denmark", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Mercaptopurine", "Odds Ratio", "Perinatal Care", "Pharmacoepidemiology", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Registries", "Sulfasalazine", "Surveys And Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "medical_condition": ["Ulcerative colitis", "Crohn's disease"]}

Accordingly, laboratory analysis typically shows normal platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT) and activated thromboplastin times (aPTT), but defective platelet aggregation responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine and collagen as well as prolonged bleeding time. Consequently, in GT patients a haemorrhagic mucocutaneous diathesis in terms of recurrent epistaxis, gingival bleedings and menorrhagia is commonplace from childhood and can mostly be handled by conservative means including local pressure application, tamponade, topical haemostatics as well as antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid. Clinical management, however, has to take into account that in GT patients bleeding after trauma or even minor invasive procedures may be severe and unpredictable and platelet transfusion remains the most common treatment [1,3]. Here, we report on the case of a 35-year-old GT type II woman presenting to us with primary infertility in July, 2010. The diagnosis of GT type II had been established by flow cytometry (platelets with 5\u201320% residual aIIbb3) already several years ago. The woman had a negative familial history for this condition, and no consanguineous marriages were known in her family. From infancy, as prominent GT symptoms the patient repeatedly experienced easy bruising, nasal as well as gingival bleedings which turned out controllable by the above-mentioned conventional treatment options including antifibrinolytics. At the age of 10, due to prolonged bleeding at menarche the patient had required platelet transfusion. On present admission, the woman\u2019s haematologic workup among other items demonstrated a normal platelet count (181 000 lL ), PT (13 s) and aPTT (28 s), but absent platelet aggregation responses to ADP, epinephrine and collagen as well as prolonged bleeding time (>15 min). In addition, the presence of anti-HLA but not of anti-integrin aIIbb3 allo-antibodies could be detected. Prior diagnostic laparoscopy and contrastenhanced (Echovist-200; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) ultrasonography of the Fallopian tubes had revealed no pathological findings. Relating to conservative treatment options, the patient reported on five cycles of intrauterine insemination without success. Consequently, in our hospital the indication for in vitro fertilization (IVF) was made. In October 2010, employing a 19-gauge single-lumen needle (Gynetics, Lommel, Belgium) we performed follicle aspiration by means of a single transvaginal puncture on each side. Puncturing and oocyte collection were guided by a standard ultrasound equipment (Sonoline Prima; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Post interventionally, there was no vaginal bleeding besides a pale red discharge. Nor did careful ultrasound monitoring show any persistent intraovarian haemorrhage. The patient did not complain of any lower abdominal pain. Oocyte retrieval was followed by IVF and embryo transfer resulting in a normal and uneventful pregnancy. Ultrasound controls of the child showed no pathological findings at any time. Recurrent epistaxis and gingival bleedings during pregnancy could be managed by topical measures and tranexamic acid. In 38 + 1 weeks of gestation we performed a primary Caesarean section due to the elevated risk of peripartal bleeding and delivered an apparently healthy child (Apgar scores 7\u20139\u201310). Intraoperatively, there was no evidence of significant blood loss except for a slight bleeding from the left rectus abdominis muscle which, however, could be arrested by electrocoagulation and myosuture. Nevertheless, the patient received two erythrocyte transfusions postoperatively due to a haemoglobin concentration of 7.1 g dL . All follow-up tests of the child showed normal function of thrombocytes and coagulation, so no further genetic testing was indicated. Follicle puncture for IVF as well as Caesarean section was performed under general anaesthesia as regional anaesthesia is unequivocally contra-indicated in GT and no heparin was administered postoperatively [4]. Peri-interventional bleeding prophylaxis of follicle aspiration as well as Caesarean section was co-managed by a Heidelberg haemophilia centre with special expertise in GT. According to current guidelines [4], bleeding prophylaxis consisted of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) 90 lg kg 1 given i.v. immediately prior to the intervention and repeated at twohourly intervals for at least 24 h in combination with antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid (3 9 1000 mg p.o. day ). In the case of follicle aspiration, this regimen of bleeding prophylaxis was commenced at the time of intervention and maintained with gradual reduction of drug dosages (rFVIIa \u2013 NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk, Mainz, Germany \u2013 at two-hourly intervals from 0 to 24 h, at three-hourly intervals from 24 to 36 h, and at fourto six-hourly intervals from 36 h post interventionally) until the patient\u2019s discharge without any further medication on the third post interventional day followed by regular gynaecologic and haemostaseologic ambulatory control. The above bleeding prophylaxis was likewise administered relating to the Caesarean section although in that case for a longer duration. On the sixth postoperative day, the woman (with only tranexamic acid, 3 9 1000 mg p.o. day , being prescribed for another week) and the infant were discharged in good condition and the follow-up evaluation remained uneventful to date. In a recent review of the literature [5], in 35 women with GT, 40 pregnancies resulting in 38 live births were reported confirming that GT confers increased maternal risk of primary and secondary postpartum haemorrhage and foetal risk of bleeding from alloimmune thrombocytopenia. We are unaware, however, of any report on successful IVF and pregnancy in GT, as communicated here. As to our patient\u2019s IVF and Caesarean section, under close surveillance of expert haemostaseologists for prophylaxis of bleeding peri-interventional rFVIIa together with antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid was chosen as currently the best therapeutic approach according to an international GT registry [1,5,6]. Platelet transfusions were not applied to avoid maternal alloimmunization [7] in the form of antiplatelet antibody development (esp. anti-integrin aIIbb3) and transfusion-transmitted infections. To summarize, this report demonstrates that even in a GT patient a concerted multi-disciplinary input of expertise, although logistically demanding and with respect to rFVIIa particularly costly, may lead to successful IVF, pregnancy and delivery of a healthy neonate.

According to the AJCC staging system, there were no significant survival differences between T4a and T4b categories (P = .299). The T4 category was thus redefined as T4a' category (\u22643.5 cm) and T4b' category (>3.5 cm) based on the tumor size, which was more powerful for distinguishing the prognosis (P = .003). Further analysis showed that the T category was significantly associated with both lymph node (LN) location and count (P < .001). Therefore, the N category was modified by combining the LN location and count. Finally, the above-mentioned novel T and N categories were adopted to modify the 8th AJCC classification using the recursive partitioning analysis principle, and the modified staging system outperformed the current edition (C-index, 0.811 vs. 0.792). The 8th AJCC staging system was improved based on the intrinsic relationship among the T category, LN location, and LN count, which would have a positive impact on the clinical decision-making process and appropriate surveillance.", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "design_model_description": "Retrospective study", "data_source_name": "Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry", "redirection_link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37311049", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "journal": null, "design_model": "Not specified", "summary": null, "keywords": ["AJCC", "SEER", "Medullary Thyroid Cancer", "Prognosis", "Staging"], "chemicals": [], "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": "37311049", "authors": ["Zhengshi Wang", "Xin Fan", "Xiaojuan Zha", "Yong Xu", "Zhiqiang Yin", "Youlutuziayi Rixiati", "Fei Yu"], "retrieved_from": ["PubMed"], "category": "Publication refering to a registry", "pdf_link": null, "title": "A Proposed Modified Staging System for Medullary Thyroid Cancer: A SEER Analysis With Multicenter Validation.", "medical_condition": ["Medullary thyroid cancer"], "population_size": 1450, "mesh_terms": ["Humans", "Neoplasm Staging", "SEER Program", "Prognosis", "Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine", "Thyroid Neoplasms"], "population_description": "Patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)"}

Previous studies in the pre-rituximab era have identified the worse outcomes in primary extranodal DLBCL compared with nodal DLBCL. However, there have been reported conflicting datas about outcomes of primary extranodal DLBCL compared with nodal DLBCL in the rituximab era. Primary breast DLBCL is one of the extremely rare extranodal lymphoma. As in other primary extranodal lymphoma, few clinical studies have been reported for investigating the efficacy of rituximab in patients with primary breast DLBCL. For clarifying this, a large randomized trial comparing survival in patients with primary breast DLBCL is required. However, the rarity of primary breast DLBCL makes large trial virtually difficult in single center or study group. Additionally, retrospective studies for evaluating the role of rituximab in primary breast DLBCL had bias according to the difference of treatment period between CHOP and R-CHOP era. Thus, to investigate the impact of rituximab in primary breast DLBCL, we performed a matched pair analysis following strict matching criteria in patients with primary breast and nodal DLBCL treated with R-CHOP.\n\nMaterials and methods Primary breast DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP was identified from 11 hospitals in Korea between May 2004 and August 2009. The eligibility criteria included: (1) histologically confirmed DLBCL, (2) Ann Arbor stage I or II of primary breast DLBCL, defined as isolated breast involvement with or without nodal disease, (3) received front-line treatment with R-CHOP. Each primary breast DLBCL patient was matched to three nodal DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP during the same period from the data registry of Korean Lymphoma Working Party. The patients were matched for 5 known prognostic factors: age (<60 vs. \u226560), Ann Arbor stage (I vs. II), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (0-1 vs. 2\u20133), serum LDH level (normal vs. elevated), and B symptom (absent vs. present). All factors should be matched between the four matched patients.\n\nResults Twenty-five patients with primary breast DLBCL were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 56 (range, 21\u201379) years and all patients were female. The Ann Arbor stage was I in 13 patients (52%) and II in 12 patients (48%). ECOG PS was 0 or 1 in 23 patients (92%), B symptom was present in 1 patient (4%), and serum LDH level was elevated in 9 patients (36%). Thus, stage-modified international prognostic index (IPI) was 0 or 1 in 20 patients (80%). Eight patients (32%) were received 3 or 4 cycles of R-CHOP followed by involved field radiotherapy and 17 patients (68%) were treated with 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP. After matching process, stage-modified IPI, treatment strategy, radiation dose, and follow-up duration as well as 5 matching factors were not significantly different between primary breast and nodal DLBCL groups. With a median follow-up of 34.3 (range, 4.4\u201376.2) months, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS; 70.0% [59.9-80.1] vs. 85.2% [79.9-90.5], p=0.145) and overall survival (OS; 82.2% [72.6-92.8] vs. 90.0% [86.0-94.0], p=0.528) was not statistically different between primary breast and nodal DLBCL groups. In multivariate analysis, 2 or 3 risk factors of stage-modified IPI were independent prognostic factor for worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.18; 95% CI, 1.22\u20138.30) and OS (HR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.55\u201315.33). Comparing 3-year cumulative incidence of progression between primary breast and nodal DLBCL, extranodal progression in the breast or central nervous system (CNS) was significantly higher in the primary breast DLBCL than nodal DLBCL (23.6 \u00b1 9.3% vs. 1.4 \u00b1 1.3%, p<0.001, respectively).\n\nConclusions In the post rituximab era, the survival outcomes of primary breast DLBCL were not significantly inferior to those of nodal DLBCL. These results suggest adding rituximab improve survival in primary breast DLBCL as in nodal DLBCL, so that the results provide evidence to add rituximab in this rare extranodal DLBCL. However, even including rituximab, extranodal progression in the breast or CNS was observed still high. Thus, further larger studies of international collaboration to confirm these results are warranted.\n\nDisclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.", "population_follow_up": "Median follow-up of 34.3 months", "design_model_description": "Matched pair analysis following strict matching criteria", "data_source_name": "Consortium for Improving Survival of Lymphoma (CISL) Study", "journal": "Blood", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "redirection_link": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1472cc6d66d61fc751d64adc12563de180bb1ba0", "design_model": "Not specified", "summary": "A matched pair analysis following strict matching criteria in patients with primary breast and nodal DLBCL treated with R-CHOP found that stage-modified international prognostic index (IPI), treatment strategy, radiation dose, and follow-up duration as well as 5 matching factors were not significantly different between primary BreastDLBCL groups.", "keywords": null, "chemicals": null, "pmid": null, "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "retrieved_from": ["Semantic Scholar"], "authors": ["H.

While systemic oral anticoagulation (OAC) continues to be the mainstay for stroke reduction therapy in patients with NVAF, several barriers prevent the sustained long-term use of OAC, including increased risk of bleeding, non-compliance, cost, drug-drug interactions, and the need for ongoing laboratory testing. Given the need for continued stroke reduction therapies in patients who are intolerant of or non-compliant with OAC, percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion (LAAO) has emerged as a nonpharmacologic alternative to OAC. The development of percutaneous LAAO techniques is based on data suggesting that more than 90% of thrombi in patients with NVAF originate in the LAA. Two percutaneous LAAO devices are currently in widespread clinical use: Watchman (United States and Europe) and the Amplatzer type of devices (Europe); randomized trial data exist only for the Watchman device. Multiple randomized and nonrandomized trials and registries have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of LAAO in patients who are suitable for short-term anticoagulation using a variety of post-procedural antithrombotic strategies. Ongoing randomized clinical trials on LAAO are focused on OAC-ineligible patients to compare efficacy of LAAO devices against a multitude of antithrombotic options. This review aims to discuss the rationale and evidence for LAAO and post procedural antithrombotic strategies and opportunities for research examination.

Cases were neonates diagnosed with either arterial or venous thrombosis during their NICU stay and controls were matched to the cases in the same patient pool in a 1:4 ratio on the basis of gestational age and presence or absence of CAD. Neonates with a less than 72-hour stays in the NICU or complex congenital heart defects needing surgical repair as well as re-admission data were excluded. Chi-square tests were performed to compare characteristics as well as potential risk factors between cases and controls. A conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis included potential risk factors with p-value Results A total of 47 cases were identified in 4,122 NICU patients (11.4 per 1,000 patients). There were 32 (68%) males and 27 (57.5%) preterm neonates with thrombosis. On univariate analysis blood stream infections (BSI) and prolonged mechanical ventilation were significantly more common in cases than controls Table 1. A conditional multivariate analysis showed that prolonged mechanical ventilation was independently associated with higher risk of thrombosis (OR 3.03 [95% CI: 1.29, 7.09], p value 0.01 Table 2). Conclusions The incidence of thrombosis appears to be 5 fold higher than that previously reported in a Canadian registry. After matching for CAD and GA, prolonged mechanical ventilation represents an independent risk factor of thrombosis in neonates. This is the largest study of systematic assessment of risk factors in neonates with mechanical ventilation being reported as a risk factor independent of CAD. Larger multi-centered data should confirm the study results for developing evidence-based risk stratification protocols and thrombosis prevention strategies.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and prognosis in patients with septic shock. This was a multicenter prospective observational study of adult patients with septic shock who were admitted to four intensive care units (ICUs) in a total of three Jiangsu Province teaching hospitals over a 3-year span from May 8, 2018, to June 15, 2021. Each enrolled patients with septic shock was categorized into the low-volume (below 20\u00a0mL/kg fluid), medium-volume (20-30\u00a0mL/kg fluid) or high-volume (above 30\u00a0mL/kg fluid) fluid group according to the initial infusion dose given for fluid resuscitation. Various demographic attributes and other variables were collected from medical records. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis were used to determine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and patient outcomes. A total of 302 patients who presented to the ICU were diagnosed with septic shock.

In these clinical settings, the efficacy and safety of sugammadex use has not yet been confirmed. We investigated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in the absence of neuromuscular monitoring. One hundred and forty patients who underwent laryngeal microsurgery with the use of rocuronium as a neuromuscular blocking agent, without the use of a neuromuscular monitoring device, were retrospectively investigated. The patients were randomly chosen among all the patients who met the inclusion criteria at a tertiary university hospital between July 2013 and February 2015 and were allocated to group S (sugammadex group) or group P (pyridostigmine group) according to the neuromuscular reversal agent administered. Five patients were excluded from analysis and 135 patients completed the study. Primary outcome was extubation time. Secondary outcomes were anaesthesia time, the correlation between anaesthesia time and extubation time, the total amount of rocuronium, and postoperative adverse events in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). Extubation time was significantly shorter in group S (6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9\u00a0min) than in group P (9.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u00a0min).

Another objective was to characterise the group born in 1991-1998 with respect to gross motor function, spasticity and growth. Data were obtained from the CP register of western Sweden and rehabilitation records. After a rise to 1.27 per 1000 live births in 1983-1986, the prevalence decreased significantly, in children born both preterm and at term, to 0.69 in 1995-1998. After 1975, more children were born preterm than at term. There was a significant decrease in severe bilateral spastic CP during the same period, mainly in children born at term. In all, 46% of the children born at term and 33% of those born preterm had a severe motor impairment, i.e. no walking ability. In the 167 children born in 1991-1998, the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) level was I in 14%, II in 34%, III in 10%, IV in 25% and V in 17%. The GMFCS level correlated with the gross motor function measure (GMFM) and the Ashworth spasticity scores, as well as with the deviation in postnatal weight and height.

F508del, the most common CFTR mutation that causes CF, is found in up to 80% to 90% of people with CF. In people with this mutation, a full length of protein is transcribed, but recognised as misfolded by the cell and degraded before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be positioned to effect transepithelial salt transport. This severe mutation is associated with no meaningful CFTR function. A corrective therapy for this mutation could positively impact on an important proportion of the CF population. To evaluate the effects of CFTR correctors on clinically important outcomes, both benefits and harms, in children and adults with CF and class II CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and online trials registries. Most recent search: 24 February 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel design) comparing CFTR correctors to placebo in people with CF with class II mutations. We also included RCTs comparing CFTR correctors combined with CFTR potentiators to placebo. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Study authors were contacted for additional data. We included 13 RCTs (2215 participants), lasting between 1 day and 24 weeks. Additional safety data from an extension study of two lumacaftor-ivacaftor studies were available at 96 weeks (1029 participants). We assessed monotherapy in seven RCTs (317 participants) (4PBA (also known as Buphenyl), CPX, lumacaftor or cavosonstat) and combination therapy in six RCTs (1898 participants) (lumacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor) compared to placebo. Twelve RCTs recruited individuals homozygous for F508del, one RCT recruited participants with one F508del mutation and a second mutation with residual function.Risk of bias varied in its impact on the confidence we have in our results across different comparisons. Some findings were based on single RCTs that were too small to show important effects. For five RCTs, results may not be applicable to all individuals with CF due to age limits of recruited populations (i.e. adults only, children only) or non-standard design of converting from monotherapy to combination therapy.Monotherapy versus placeboNo deaths were reported and there were no clinically relevant improvements in quality of life in any RCT. There was insufficient evidence available from individual studies to determine the effect of any of the correctors examined on lung function outcomes.No placebo-controlled study of monotherapy demonstrated a difference in mild, moderate or severe adverse effects; however, it is difficult to assess the clinical relevance of these events with the variety of events and the small number of participants.Combination therapy versus placeboNo deaths were reported during any RCT (moderate- to high-quality evidence). The quality of life scores (respiratory domain) favoured combination therapy (both lumacaftor-ivacaftor and tezacaftor-ivacaftor) compared to placebo at all time points. At six months lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg once daily) plus ivacaftor improved Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) scores by a small amount compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 2.62 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 4.59); 1061 participants; high-quality evidence). A similar effect size was observed for twice-daily lumacaftor (200 mg) plus ivacaftor (250 mg) although the quality of evidence was low (MD 2.50 points (95% CI 0.10 to 5.10)). The mean increase in CFQ scores with twice-daily tezacaftor (100 mg) and ivacaftor (150 mg) was approximately five points (95% CI 3.20 to 7.00; 504 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Lung function measured by relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV There is insufficient evidence that monotherapy with correctors has clinically important effects in people with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation.Combination therapies (lumacaftor-ivacaftor and tezacaftor-ivacaftor) each result in similarly small improvements in clinical outcomes in people with CF; specifically improvements quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), in respiratory function (high-quality evidence) and lower pulmonary exacerbation rates (moderate-quality evidence). Lumacaftor-ivacaftor is associated with an increase in early transient shortness of breath and longer-term increases in blood pressure (high-quality evidence). These adverse effects were not observed for tezacaftor-ivacaftor. Tezacaftor-ivacaftor has a better safety profile, although data are not available for children younger than 12 years. In this age group, lumacaftor-ivacaftor had an important impact on respiratory function with no apparent immediate safety concerns, but this should be balanced against the increase in blood pressure and shortness of breath seen in longer-term data in adults when considering this combination for use in young people with CF.", "data_source_name": "not specified", "design_model_description": "Randomized Control Trial (RCT)", "population_follow_up": "Up to 24 weeks (most RCTs), with additional safety data from an extension study at 96 weeks", "redirection_link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30070364", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "design_model": "Not specified", "summary": "Evaluating the effects of CFTR correctors on clinically important outcomes, both benefits and harms, in children and adults with CF and class II CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del) and combination therapy in six RCTs found that the quality of life scores (respiratory domain) favoured combination therapy and risk of bias varied in its impact on the confidence in the results.", "keywords": [], "chemicals": ["Aminophenols", "Aminopyridines", "Benzodioxoles", "CFTR protein, human", "Drug Combinations", "Indoles", "Phenylbutyrates", "Quinolones", "lumacaftor, ivacaftor drug combination", "tezacaftor", "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "ivacaftor", "4-phenylbutyric acid", "lumacaftor"], "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": "30070364", "authors": ["Kevin W Southern", "Sanjay Patel", "Ian P Sinha", "Sarah J Nevitt"], "retrieved_from": ["PubMed", "Semantic Scholar"], "category": "Publication refering to a registry", "pdf_link": "https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc6513216?pdf=render", "population_description": "Patients with cystic fibrosis and class II CFTR mutations, most commonly F508del", "title": "Correctors (specific therapies for class II CFTR mutations) for cystic fibrosis.", "population_size": 2215, "mesh_terms": ["Adult", "Aminophenols", "Aminopyridines", "Benzodioxoles", "Child", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "Drug Combinations", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Indoles", "Mutation", "Phenylbutyrates", "Quinolones", "Randomized Controlled Trials As Topic"], "medical_condition": ["Cystic fibrosis"]}

The motivation stems in part from interest in reducing the number of transfusions by the use of more restrictive hemoglobin triggers for red blood cell transfusions in orthopedic surgery patients. The authors observe that both lower utilization and comparable or improved patient outcomes followed implementation of the blood management program and conclude that a \u201chemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dl appears to be safe for many orthopedic patients.\u201d There is a clear need to understand the relationship between transfusion triggers and outcomes to ensure that limited resources are used judiciously, to minimize exposures of patients, and to optimize patient outcomes. The study by Gupta et al.1 offers a good illustration of the kinds of retrospective analyses often conducted based on data from large registries or administrative databases. There have been a number of studies in transfusion medicine which involved retrospective database analyses yielding findings that, when tested in prospective randomized trials, were not validated. For example, in a large retrospective analysis of 4,470 intensive care unit patients, H\u00e9bert et al.2 observed an association between lower hemoglobin concentrations and death. However, when they tested this hypothesis in a subsequent randomized trial in 838 similar intensive care unit patients, there was no evidence of differences in mortality between the liberally and restrictively transfused groups that were transfused to hemoglobin concentrations of 10.7 and 8.5 g/dl.3 In a retrospective analysis directed at the effect of red blood cell storage duration, Koch et al.4 suggested that cardiac surgery patients transfused with red cells stored for longer periods of time experienced a higher mortality rate than did patients transfused with red cells having shorter storage durations; a subsequent larger retrospective analysis of all transfusions in Denmark and Sweden by Edgren et al.5 showed different results. Exposure of patients with cardiovascular disease to red cells of particularly long storage duration was also associated with increased in-hospital mortality in a retrospective registry analysis by Eikelboom et al.,6 but these findings were not validated in a subsequent analysis based on an expanded dataset.7 Seven prospective randomized trials addressing this question did not substantiate the findings of Koch et al., finding no difference between red cells storage duration and mortality, change in multiple organ dysfunction scores, composite morbidity, pulmonary and immune function, lactate clearance, and reversal of anemia-induced neurocognitive function in a wide range of populations: cardiac surgery, critically ill adults, children with severe anemia, low-weight premature infants, all hospitalized patients, and healthy volunteers.8\u201314 The current publication affords an opportunity to discuss some challenges arising in retrospective analyses, which are highlighted below. The themes include the post hoc definition exposure variables and the interpretation of their effects, the challenge of dealing completely and rigorously with the effect of confounding variables, incomplete data, and the use of composite outcomes.

Objectives To understand the prevalence of RA patients with inadequate response to therapy with 2 csDMARDs and describe time to initiation of a biologic agent for this patient population. Methods Patients enrolled in the Corrona RA registry as of January 2015 were included in this analysis. \u201cInadequate response\u201d to 2 csDMARDs was defined as being on moderate or high disease activity (CDAI >10) six months after the initiation of 2 csDMARDs. The index visit was defined as the first visit after 6m of being on moderate or high CDAI after the initiation of 2 csDMARDs. The population of biologic na\u00efve patients at index visit, with at least 6 months of additional follow up were observed longitudinally to calculate the time to initiation of a biologic agent. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the time to biologic initiation. Results 2723 RA patients treated with 2 csDMARDs for at least 6 months were identified. At the time of the index visit: 1774 (65.1%) patients had responded to 2 csDMARDs, 192 (7.1%) had started a biologic, and 135 (4.9%) patients with inadequate response to 2 csDMARDs and did not have at least 6 months of additional follow up post-index visit. The final number of inadequate responders to 2 csDMARDs included in this analysis was 622 (22.9%) patients (79.1% female, 60.9\u00b112.7 mean age, 9.0\u00b19.9 mean duration of RA, 19.5\u00b18.9 mean CDAI at index visit). The median follow up time for this population was 32.5 months. Among the 622 patients, 227 initiated a biologic during the follow up time. The median time to initiation of a biologic was 75 months (95% CI: 53\u201397 months). Among the 227 patients who initiated the biologic, the mean (SD) time to initiation was 17.7 (\u00b121.7) months (figure 1). While for some patients disease activity fluctuated between low/remission and moderate/high until the initiation of a biologic agent, for 57.3% of patients remained persistently in moderate or high disease activity over the follow-up. Conclusions A significant percentage of RA patients treated with 2 csDMARDs did not respond adequately to such therapy in the population studied. Prolonged time until the initiation of a biologic agent was noted for this patient population.

It is unclear if pre-intervention IV tPA increases complications of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in this group. Hypothesis: We assessed the hypothesis that pre-intervention IV tPA does not increase the risk of complications in acute ischemic stroke patients (AIS) who require concurrent mechanical thrombectomy and emergent CAS. Methods: Patients undergoing both mechanical thrombectomy and CAS within 24 hours of stroke onset were identified from the Merci Registry, a prospective database of AIS patients treated with the Merci Retriever. Those receiving IV tPA were compared with those that did not for associations with functional independence (mRS 0-2) and risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). The primary endpoint for this study was the percentage of patients with mRS 0-2 at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included 90-day mortality and sICH. Outcomes were compared with Fisher\u2019s exact test. Results: 103 patients were included. Thirty received IV tPA (mean age 59.1, time to treatment 6.3 hrs, median NIHSS 18) and 74 did not (mean age 66.1, time to treatment 9.8 hrs, median NIHSS 16). Although numerically higher, there was no significant difference in sICH at 24 hours, occurring in 18.2% (4/22) of IV tPA patients and 7.3% (4/55) of patients without IV tPA (p=0.22) [sICH data was not available on 28 patients].

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that concomitant IV tPA use in acute stroke patients who had simultaneous mechanical thrombectomy and CAS did not significantly affect patient outcomes or increase complications.

Dengue control in Malaysia is currently based on reactive vector management within 24\u2009h of a dengue case being reported. Preventive rather than reactive vector control approaches, with combined interventions, are expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of dengue control programs. The principal objective of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to quantify the effectiveness of a preventive integrated vector management (IVM) strategy on the incidence of dengue as compared to routine vector control efforts. The trial is conducted in randomly allocated clusters of low- and medium-cost housing located in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. The IVM approach combines: targeted outdoor residual spraying with K-Othrine Polyzone, deployment of mosquito traps as auto-dissemination devices, and community engagement activities. The trial includes 300 clusters randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio. The clusters receive either the preventive IVM in addition to the routine vector control activities or the routine vector control activities only. Epidemiological data from monthly confirmed dengue cases during the study period will be obtained from the Vector Borne Disease Sector, Malaysian Ministry of Health e-Dengue surveillance system. Entomological surveillance data will be collected in 12 clusters randomly selected from each arm. To measure the effectiveness of the IVM approach on dengue incidence, a negative binomial regression model will be used to compare the incidence between control and intervention clusters. To quantify the effect of the interventions on the main entomological outcome, ovitrap index, a modified ordinary least squares regression model using a robust standard error estimator will be used. Considering the ongoing expansion of dengue burden in Malaysia, setting up proactive control strategies is critical. Despite some limitations of the trial such as the use of passive surveillance to identify cases, the results will be informative for a better understanding of effectiveness of proactive IVM approach in the control of dengue.

At the skin level, psoriasis is characterized by localized or widespread thick raised silvery-white scaling and pruritic plaques and studies have shown that psoriasis negatively affects patients' quality of life, and depression occurs more often in patients with psoriasis. However, data have shown that psoriasis is a systemic disease which affects the joints, vasculature, and other tissues as well. Indeed, approximately one-third of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, and patients with severe psoriasis have a shortened life expectancy. Although our knowledge of the pathogenesis of psoriasis has advanced significantly in the past decade, as have the pharmacological treatment options which are now available, several important knowledge gaps remain. Many of the proinflammatory mediators involved in psoriasis have also been implicated in some central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, studies on associations between psoriasis and CNS diseases are scarce. Based on nationwide registry data from the entire Danish population, the present thesis examined the associations between psoriasis and certain CNS diseases. The specific objectives of this work were to investigate the independent impact of depression on the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with psoriasis, the relationship between psoriasis and uveitis, and the risk of incident multiple sclerosis (MS) following the onset of psoriasis, respectively. The main results were a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD death in patients with psoriasis during stages of acute depression. Moreover, we found a bidirectional relationship between psoriasis and uveitis, where the occurrence of either disease significantly increased the risk of the other. Perhaps most notably, however, was that we found a psoriasis-severity dependent increased risk of MS. In conclusion, psoriasis was significantly associated with certain CNS diseases, and the risk of CVD was strongly associated with acute depression in these patients.

Among these, lung cancer is of growing importance, due to its high incidence and mortality. Chemotherapy, one of the most frequently used treatments, has shown its ability to induce accelerated immunosenescence in classic and as well non-classic lymphocyte compartments, being less described in the latter. The immune restoration strategies have demonstrated their ability to reverse immunosenescence and exhaustion markers in conventional lymphocyte subpopulations after chemotherapy. However, the possible immunorestorative effect on non-classical lymphocytes has not been widely reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy and the administration of a thymic polypeptide factor on non-classical lymphocyte populations in patients with advanced lung cancer.\nMethods: Eighteen patients with advanced lung cancer, were evaluated at baseline before and after platinum-based chemotherapy (4\u20136 cycles). All patients could complete treatment with a thymic polypeptide factor [Biomodulina T (BT)] at the end of chemotherapy. Blood from patients was collected by venipuncture in heparinized tubes before and after chemotherapy and at the end of BT treatment to analyze the frequencies of non-classical immune subpopulations by flow cytometry.\nResults: Natural killer (NK), natural killer T cells (NKT), and double-positive T lymphocyte (DPT) proportions reached normal values in patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer before receiving cytotoxic treatment. Chemotherapy did not induce modifications in the total percent of NK, NKT, and DPT populations in these patients. However, the administration of BT decreased DPTs and NK cells expressing the cluster of differentiation (CD)57 molecule, which is considered a marker of immunosenescence.\nConclusions: These results suggest a lower influence of platinum-based chemotherapy on non-classical lymphocytes and the potential to generate a reconstitution of lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with advanced lung cancer by using the thymic factor BT, which reveals a new possibility for improving the response to cancer immunotherapies [Cuban Public Registry of Clinical Trial (RPCEC, https://rpcec.sld.cu/en/trials/RPCEC00000358-En) identifier: RPCEC00000358].", "data_source_name": "Cuban Public Registry of Clinical Trial (RPCEC) identifier: RPCEC00000358", "design_model_description": "Clinical trial", "population_follow_up": "Not specified", "redirection_link": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d996e555ccb35843a4e4722c0a437baab22143a0", "population_sex": ["Not specified"], "journal": "Exploration of Immunology", "design_model": "Randomized Control Trial (RCT)", "summary": "A lower influence of platinum-based chemotherapy on non-classical lymphocytes and the potential to generate a reconstitution of lymphocyte subpopulations in patients with advanced lung cancer by using the thymic factor BT is suggested, which reveals a new possibility for improving the response to cancer immunotherapies.", "keywords": null, "chemicals": null, "population_age_group": ["Not specified"], "pmid": null, "authors": ["G.

Peri-operative interventional radiotherapy (POIRT) entails tumor resection, catheter implantation in the same surgery, and irradiation within the peri-operative period. It allows for maximal tumor burden reduction, better tumor bed identification, more flexible implant geometry, highly conformal irradiation, and treatment delay minimization. We reviewed the published local control, survival, toxicity, and quality of life (QOL) outcomes with POIRT for head and neck cancers (HNCs) in primary and re-irradiation settings. Materials and Methods. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and other databases, supplemented by bibliography scanning and hand-searching, yielded 107 titles. Fifteen unique articles were eligible, five of which were merged with more updated studies. Of the ten remaining studies, four reported on primary POIRT, and seven reported on reirradiation POIRT. Given data heterogeneity, only qualitative synthesis was performed. Results. Primary POIRT in early tongue cancer results in 6-year recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of 92% for both; in advanced HNCs, the 9-year RFS and OS rates are 52% and 55%. Grade 1-2 toxicity is very common; grade 3-4 toxicity is rare, but grade 5 toxicity has been reported. POIRT re-irradiation for recurrent HNCs results in 5y RFS and OS rates of 37-55% and 17-50%; better outcomes are achieved with gross total resection (GTR). QOL data are lacking. Conclusions. Primary POIRT is safe and effective in early tongue cancers; its use in other HNC sites, especially in advanced disease, requires careful consideration. Re-irradiation POIRT is most effective and safe when combined with GTR; toxicity is significant and may be limited by careful case selection, implant planning and execution, use of smaller fraction sizes, and adherence to homogeneity constraints.

Patient demographics, corrosive ingestion details, initial investigations, management, and short-term outcomes were described using descriptive statistics while multivariate analysis with receiver operator characteristic area under the curve graphs (ROC AUC) were used to identify factors predictive of FT necrosis and 30-day mortality.\n RESULTS\n One-hundred patients were included, with a mean age of 32 years (SD: 11.2 years) and a male predominance (65.0%). The majority (73.0%) were intentional suicide attempts. Endoscopy on admission was the most frequent initial investigation performed (95 patients), while only 17 were assessed with CT. Seventeen patients had full thickness necrosis at surgery, of which eleven underwent emergency resection and six were palliated. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 27.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Patients with full thickness necrosis and those with an established perforation had a 30-day mortality of 58.8% and 91.0%, respectively. Full thickness necrosis was associated with a cumulative 2-year survival of only 17.6%. Multivariate analyses with ROC AUC showed admission endoscopy findings, CT findings, and blood gas findings (pH, base excess, lactate), to all have significant predictive value for full thickness necrosis, with endoscopy proving to have the best predictive value (AUC 0.850). CT and endoscopy findings were the only factors predictive of early mortality, with CT performing better than endoscopy (AUC 0.798 vs 0.759).\n CONCLUSION\n Intentional corrosive injuries result in devastating morbidity and mortality.
