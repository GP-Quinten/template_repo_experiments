Multivariate analysis assessed the interaction between the hyperglycemia and ischemic stroke subtypes of large artery atherothrombosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), and small vessel occlusion (SVO) and early vascular outcomes (3-month stroke, all-cause mortality, and composite of stroke, MI, and all-cause mortality). Among the 32,772 patients (age:69.0\\u00b112.6yrs, male:58.4%) meeting eligibility criteria, 61.9% were in the normoglycemia group, 19.5% were in the moderate hyperglycemia group, and 18.7% were in the severe hyperglycemia group. Substantial interactions between hyperglycemia groups and stroke subtypes were observed for 3-month stroke (P Hyperglycemia was differently associated with the risk of 3-month stroke by ischemic stroke subtype. The associations of hyperglycemia with 3-month stroke were greatest in CE subtype but not in SVO subtype. These results suggest that the effect of glucose-lowering treatment after AIS may differ according to stroke subtype.\",\n",

      "  \"abstract\": \"Fabry disease (OMIM #301 500), the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by enzymatic defects in alpha-galactosidase A (GLA gene; Xq22.1). Fabry disease has historically been characterized by progressive renal failure, early stroke and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a diminished life expectancy. A nonclassical phenotype has been described with an almost exclusive cardiac involvement. Specific therapies with enzyme substitution or chaperone molecules are now available depending on the mutation carried. Numerous clinical and fundamental studies have been conducted without stratifying patients by phenotype or severity, despite different prognoses and possible different pathophysiologies. We aimed to identify a simple and clinically relevant way to classify and stratify patients according to their disease severity. Based on data from the French Fabry Biobank and Registry (FFABRY; n = 104; 54 males), we applied unsupervised multivariate statistics to determine clusters of patients and identify clinical criteria that would allow an effective classification of adult patients. Thanks to these criteria and empirical clinical considerations we secondly elaborate a new score that allow the severity stratification of patients. We observed that the absence of acroparesthesia or cornea verticillata is sufficient to classify males as having the nonclassical phenotype. We did not identify criteria that significantly cluster female patients. The classical phenotype was associated with a higher risk of severe renal (HR = 35.1; p <10-3) and cardiac events (HR = 4.8; p = 0.008) and a trend toward a higher risk of severe neurological events (HR = 7.7; p = 0.08) compared to nonclassical males. Our simple, rapid and clinically-relevant FFABRY score gave concordant results with the validated MSSI. Acroparesthesia and cornea verticillata are simple clinical criteria that efficiently stratify Fabry patients, defining 3 different groups: females and males with nonclassical and classical phenotypes of significantly different severity. The FFABRY score allows severity stratification of Fabry patients.\",\n",

However, previous studies show that PPBC is associated with worse outcome with higher rates of metastasis than in young women's breast cancer (YWBC). We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of PPBC based on the diagnosis period of PPBC. We retrospectively reviewed 208,780 patients with breast cancer from the Korean Breast Cancer Society registry (KBCSR) database between January 2000 and December 2014. We included premenopausal women aged 20-50\\u00a0years who underwent breast cancer surgery. The patients were classified by 5-year intervals according to the diagnosis period of breast cancer, from the first birth to the breast cancer diagnosis. Compared with patients in the other groups, patients diagnosed within postpartum 5\\u00a0years (PPBC\\u2009<\\u20095\\u00a0years) group were younger, had a more advanced stage, had lower estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, and had a higher human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive rate. Further, PPBC\\u2009<\\u20095\\u00a0years group had a worse survival rate than the nulliparous and other groups (5-year cumulative survival: PPBC\\u2009<\\u20095\\u00a0years group, 89%; nulliparous group, 97.3%; 5\\u2009\\u2264\\u2009PPBC\\u2009<\\u200910\\u00a0years group, 93%). In the multivariate analysis, the PPBC\\u2009<\\u20095\\u00a0years group was associated with a worse survival rate (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.148-2.094, p 0.004) after adjustment for age at diagnosis, breast cancer stage, ER and HER2 status, Ki-67 level, and chemotherapy. Our findings indicated that patients diagnosed with breast cancer within the first 5\\u00a0years after delivery had aggressive characteristics and a poor survival rate. It is important to elucidate the pathophysiology of PPBC and establish novel therapeutic strategies to improve the survival rate.\",\n",

Because of the speed and efficiency of 64-MDCT, we believe that diagnostic catheter angiography may be obsolete. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with 64-MDCT in the evaluation of acute traumatic aortic injury (ATAI). The trauma registry at a level 1 trauma center was reviewed to find cases of ATAI occurring between March 1, 2005, and July 31, 2007. MDCT images were correlated with transcatheter angiograms when obtained. Surgical and clinical reports were reviewed to confirm abnormal and normal findings and the stability of the conditions of patients undergoing conservative treatment. After level 1 or level 2 trauma, 1,344 patients underwent contrast-enhanced 64-MDCT. Twenty-four patients (1.79%) were found to have 25 aortic injuries. All patients had direct MDCT signs of ATAI. Ten catheter angiograms were obtained after MDCT. The presence of direct signs was confirmed in three cases. In five cases, indirect signs were found to be normal findings. In two cases, the findings remained equivocal after MDCT and conventional angiography. Fourteen patients underwent surgical repair of the aorta, six underwent conservative management, and four patients died of other injuries. No patient with equivocal or indirect findings needed surgical repair. The sensitivity of 64-MDCT was 96.0%; specificity, 99.8%; positive predictive value, 92.3%; negative predictive value, 99.9%; and accuracy, 99.8%. Direct signs of ATAI on contrast-enhanced 64-MDCT scans do not have to be confirmed with catheter angiography. In our population, diagnostic transcatheter angiography was of limited value for clarifying equivocal or indirect MDCT findings.\",\n",

      "  \"abstract\": \"There is little knowledge on socioeconomic differences in use of health care organized by different care schemes and on exclusive and concurrent use of health care at different schemes in different socioeconomic groups. In Finland, public, occupational and private schemes offer parallel outpatient primary health care services. Each scheme mainly reaches different population groups because of differences in availability, costs and gatekeeping. This study aimed to analyse how the probability of using health care organized by the three schemes differed by socioeconomic status in a working-age population. Individual-level register-based data on use of public, occupational and private outpatient primary health care during 2013 as well as data on sociodemographic covariates were linked for the total population aged 25-64 of the city of Oulu, Finland. Data were analysed with descriptive methods and multinomial logistic regression models. Those in the study population most often used only occupational care or only public care, or did not use any of the studied health care schemes at all. The lower the socioeconomic status, the higher was the probability of not using care or using only public care. The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher was the probability of using occupational care-either only occupational care or occupational care in combination with private care. Education, occupational class and income were all associated with care use also when adjusted for sociodemographic covariates and chronic disease, but income proved to be the strongest predictor of the three. The results reflect the design of the Finnish health care system, with a strong occupational health care scheme for the employed population contributing to inequality in use of health care and potentially to health inequality between socioeconomic groups.\",\n",

A \\\"pro-healing\\\" approach for prevention of post-stenting restenosis is theoretically favored over the use of cytotoxic or cytostatic local pharmacologic therapies. It is believed that the central role of the vascular endothelium is to maintain quiescence of the underlying media and adventitia. Sixteen patients with de novo coronary artery disease were successfully treated with implantation of endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) capture stents. Complete procedural and angiographic success was achieved in all 16 patients. The nine-month composite major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rate was 6.3% as a result of a symptom-driven target vessel revascularization in a single patient. There were no other MACCE despite only one month of clopidogrel treatment. At six-month follow-up, mean angiographic late luminal loss was 0.63 +/- 0.52 mm, and percent stent volume obstruction by intravascular ultrasound analysis was 27.2 +/- 20.9%. This first human clinical investigation of this technology demonstrates that the EPC capture coronary stent is safe and feasible for the treatment of de novo coronary artery disease. Further developments in this technology are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of this device for the treatment of coronary artery disease.\",\n",

We used the California Cancer Registry (1996 through 2008) to identify patients 50 to 94 years old with early-stage NSCLC. We used logistic regression models to assess whether or not insurance status (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, no insurance, and unknown) had an effect on whether or not a lobectomy (or bilobectomy) is performed. A total of 10,854 patients met our inclusion criteria. Compared with patients with private insurance, we found that patients with Medicare (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 to 0.95), Medicaid (aOR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.57), or no insurance (aOR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.70) were significantly less likely to undergo lobectomy, even after adjusting for patient factors (age, race, and gender) and tumor characteristics (histology and tumor size). Increasing age, African American race, squamous cell carcinoma, and increasing tumor size were significant independent negative predictors of whether or not a lobectomy was performed. Patients without private insurance were significantly less likely than patients with private insurance to undergo a lobectomy for early-stage NSCLC. The variables(s) contributing to this disparity have yet to be elucidated.\",\n",

      "  \"abstract\": \"Approximately 5-10% of all pancreatic cancer patients carry a predisposing mutation in a known susceptibility gene. Since >90% of patients present with late stage disease, it is crucial to identify high risk individuals who may be amenable to early detection or other prevention. To explore the spectrum of hereditary pancreatic cancer susceptibility, we evaluated germline DNA from pancreatic cancer participants (n\\u2009=\\u200953) from a large hereditary cancer registry. For those without a known predisposition mutation gene (n\\u2009=\\u200949), germline next generation sequencing was completed using targeted capture for 706 candidate genes. We identified 16 of 53 participants (30%) with a pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variant that may be related to their hereditary pancreatic cancer predisposition; seven had mutations in genes associated with well-known cancer syndromes (13%) [ATM (2), BRCA2 (3), MSH2 (1), MSH6 (1)]. Many had mutations in Fanconi anemia complex genes [BRCA2 (3 participants), FANCF, FANCM]. Eight participants had rare protein truncating variants of uncertain significance with no other P or LP variants. Earlier age of pancreatic cancer diagnosis (57.5 vs 64.8\\u00a0years) was indicative of possessing a P or LP variant, as was cancer family history (p values <0.0001). Our multigene panel approach for identifying known cancer predisposing genetic susceptibility in those at risk for hereditary pancreatic cancer may have direct applicability to clinical practice in cases with mutations in actionable genes. Future pancreatic cancer predisposition studies should include evaluation of the Fanconi anemia genes.\",\n",

There had been many studies providing several preoperative models to predict difficult LC or conversion. Randhawa's scoring system was a simple and practical predictive model for clinicians. The modification was reported to be more preferable for delayed LC. This study aimed to confirm the advantage of modified predictive model in larger sample size. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed medical records of patients who underwent LC since January 2017 to December 2021. The difficulty of operation was categorized into three groups: easy, difficult, and very difficult. Multivariate analysis was performed to define significant factors of very difficult and converted cases. The predictive scores were calculated by using the original Randhawa's model and the modification, then compared with actual outcome. Results: There were 567 cases of delayed LC in this study, with 44 cases (7.8%) converted to open cholecystectomy. Four factors (previous cholecystitis, previous endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, higher ALP, and gallbladder wall thickening) for very difficult group and five factors (previous cholecystitis, previous cholangitis, higher white blood cell count, gallbladder wall thickening, and contracted gallbladder) for conversion were significant. The modification provided the better correlation and higher area of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing with the original model. Conclusion: The modification of Randhawa's model was supposed to be more preferable for predicting the difficulty in elective LC. Thai Clinical Trials Registry No. 20220712006.\",\n",

However, limited data exist regarding the association between BNP at baseline and risks of thromboembolic events (TE) and death in NVAF patients. We prospectively studied 1,013 NVAF patients (725 men, 72.8\\u00b19.7 years old) from the Hokuriku-plus AF Registry to determine the relationship between BNP at baseline and prognosis among Japanese NVAF patients. During the follow-up period (median, 751 days); 31 patients experienced TE and there were 81 cases of TE/all-cause death. For each endpoint we constructed receiver-operating characteristic curves that gave cutoff points of BNP for TE (170 pg/mL) and TE/all-cause death (147 pg/mL). Multivariate analysis with the Cox-proportional hazards model indicated that high BNP was significantly associated with risks of TE (hazard ratio [HR] 3.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83-8.67; P=0.0003) and TE/all-cause death (HR 2.27; 95% CI 1.45-3.56; P=0.0003).

The objective of this study was to establish multimorbidity clusters from a cohort of COVID-19 patients and assess their relationship with infection severity/mortality. The MRisk-COVID Big Data study included 14 286 COVID-19 patients of the first wave in a Spanish region. The cohort was stratified by age and sex. Multimorbid individuals were subjected to a fuzzy c-means cluster analysis in order to identify multimorbidity clusters within each stratum. Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between severity/mortality and age, sex, and multimorbidity clusters. Severe infection was reported in 9.5% (95% CI: 9.0-9.9) of the patients, and death occurred in 3.9% (95% CI: 3.6-4.2). We identified multimorbidity clusters related to severity/mortality in most age groups from 21 to 65 years. In males, the cluster with highest percentage of severity/mortality was Heart-liver-gastrointestinal (81-90 years, 34.1% severity, 29.5% mortality). In females, the clusters with the highest percentage of severity/mortality were Diabetes-cardiovascular (81-95 years, 22.5% severity) and Psychogeriatric (81-95 years, 16.0% mortality). This study characterized several multimorbidity clusters in COVID-19 patients based on sex and age, some of which were found to be associated with higher rates of infection severity/mortality, particularly in younger individuals. Further research is encouraged to ascertain the role of specific multimorbidity patterns on infection prognosis and identify the most vulnerable morbidity profiles in the community. NCT04981249.

      "  \"abstract\": \"Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to compare antithrombotic regimens following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for interventional and observational studies comparing OAC to OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). Results: Five studies were included (four registry-based and one randomized controlled trial), comprising a total of 1318 patients. Our meta-analysis revealed lower rates of severe bleeding (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.46 [0.31, 0.69], P<0.01, I2=0%) and major bleeding (pooled OR 0.46 [0.27,0.79], P<0.01, I2=0%) for the OAC group than for the OAC-plus-SAPT group. There was a nonsignificant trend towards reduced life-threatening bleeding events in the OAC group (pooled OR 0.54 [0.27,1.08], P=0.08, I2=11%). There was no difference between groups in the risks of stroke (pooled OR 1.02 [0.58,1.80], P=0.58, I2= 0%) or all-cause mortality (pooled OR 1.04 [0.75,1.42], P=0.83, I2= 0%) after TAVI. Conclusions: Our pooled analysis suggests that for patients with an indication for long-term OAC after TAVI, double anti-thrombotic therapy, compared to OAC alone, increased the risk of bleeding without reducing cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality.\",\n",

      "  \"abstract\": \"The present review provides an update on the recent literature regarding disease-specific issues in lung transplantation. Some of the published data will help refine previously published candidate selection criteria and provide evidence-based data for choice of procedures. Recent studies on lung transplant outcomes in older patients underline that satisfactory results can be obtained in patients older than 60 years but not in patients older than 70 years. Data from two large registry-based studies indicate that bilateral lung transplantation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease confers significantly longer survival than single lung transplantation, especially in patients younger than 60 years. Mathematical models to estimate survival benefit in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung transplant candidates have been developed and are being validated. The impact of Bcc colonization in cystic fibrosis patients on outcome has been nuanced; thus, cystic fibrosis lung transplant candidates colonized by particular Bcc strains may be transplanted with good outcomes. Novel surgical approaches to peculiar situations in end-stage cystic fibrosis have been described. Candidate selection criteria for retransplantation procedures have further been clarified. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the currently important topics for clinicians involved in referring and evaluating patients with end-stage lung disease for lung transplantation in 2009.\",\n",

This prospective, multicenter study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2400085035). From October 2018 to February 2024, a total of 303 breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven positive LN were enrolled. The conventional US features of axillary LNs and SWE characteristics of breast lesions after NAT were analyzed. The diagnostic performances of axilla US, breast SWE, and their combination in detecting residual metastasis in axillary level III after NAT were assessed. Pathologically positive LN(s) in axilla level III were detected in 13.75% of cases following NAT. The kappa value for the axilla level with positive LN confirmed by surgical pathology and detected by US is 0.39 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The AUC of conventional axilla US to determine the status of axilla level III LNs after NAT was 0.67, with a sensitivity of 51.52%, a specificity of 74.36%. The breast SWE displayed moderate performance for detecting residual metastasis in axilla level III following NAT, with an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 84.85%, and specificity of 74.36%. Compared to axilla US and breast SWE alone, the combination of axilla US with breast SWE achieved a stronger discriminatory ability (AUC, 0.86 vs 0.67 vs 0.79, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, Delong's test) and precise calibration (X SWE outperformed conventional US in identifying the axilla levels with nodal metastasis following NAT in patients with initially diagnosed positive axilla. Furthermore, combining breast SWE with axilla US showed good diagnostic performance for detecting residual metastasis in axilla level III after NAT.\",\n",
